  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the perspectives of English as a Foreign Language Special Education teachers (EFLSE) regarding game-based learning approaches for addressing behavioral disorders in ADHD patients. Method: The study involved a sample ( n = 131) of EFLSE teachers who completed a questionnaire to determine how feasible, acceptable, and helpful they found game-based learning. Results: The study revealed that EFLSE teachers perceive game-based learning to be a feasible and acceptable method for engaging ADHD students and helping to maintain their attention during game-based learning activities. Nevertheless, implementation and individualized approaches are cited as challenges. Additionally, EFLSE teachers emphasized the benefits of game-based learning, including improved problem-solving, assessment methods, collaboration, and the acquisition of academic skills.
