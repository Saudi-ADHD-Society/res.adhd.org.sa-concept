  "title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dental traumatic injuries: a systemic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess whether individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit a higher prevalence of traumat- ic dental injuries (TDIs) compared to those with- out ADHD through a systematic review and me- ta-analysis of the existing literature.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A search strat- egy using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) vocabulary was employed for a comprehen- sive search across various databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Li- brary, and Embase. The Joanna Briggs Institute Summary was utilized for data collection. Addi- tionally, quality assessment, meta-analysis, and bias control were conducted to ensure the reli- ability of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed to consolidate the findings of the individual studies.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of TDIs among indi- viduals with ADHD ranged from 9.6% to 68.2%, while in the healthy control group, it ranged from 0.8% to 44.7%. The meta-analysis findings revealed that individuals with ADHD had 1.98 times higher odds (OR = 1.98, ranging from 1.51 to 2.59 with 95% CI) of experiencing TDIs com- pared to individuals without ADHD.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest a significant association between ADHD and an increased risk of TDIs. Individ- uals with ADHD were found to be nearly twice as likely to experience TDIs compared to those without ADHD. Efforts should not only be direct- ed towards improving the oral health of this vul- nerable group of individuals, but also health- care practitioners need to be provided with op- portunities to create awareness and implement preventive measures to mitigate the risk of TDIs among individuals with ADHD.",
