  "title": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in a Patient with Lujan-Fryns Syndrome: A Case Report",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Lujan-Fryns syndrome (LFS), a rare genetic anomaly first described in 1984, is characterized by a unique constellation of clinical features primarily attributed to mutations in the MED12 gene. These features include intellectual disability, behavioral complexities, and distinct somatic attributes. Although formal psychiatric criteria are lacking, numerous case studies have revealed a co-occurrence of LFS with psychological manifestations, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This case report explores the intricate relationship between LFS and ADHD, shedding light on potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
