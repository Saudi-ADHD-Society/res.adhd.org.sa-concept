    "title": "A Comprehensive Bibliometric Analysis of Disability Research in Saudi Arabia: Trends, Gaps, and Future Directions",
    "abstract": "This study employed bibliometric analysis using the Scopus database to evaluate Saudi disability research (SDR). From an initial dataset of 17,102 documents (0.54% of global output), the scope was refined to 13,246 data-driven publications for detailed examination. Trends, themes, and collaborations were analyzed using R packages and VOSviewer. Metrics such as citations, total link strength (TLS), and thematic mapping were used to identify key contributors, emerging topics, and international partnerships. Saudi authors demonstrated strong international collaboration, with 59.53% of publications involving co-authorships, particularly with the United States, Egypt, and India. Prolific contributors include Alkuraya, F.S. and leading institutions such as King Saud University. Key motor themes include “quality of life” and “Alzheimer’s disease,” while emerging themes such as “deep learning” and “molecular docking” reflect a shift toward advanced technologies. Machine learning is a trending topic applied in early diagnosis, drug discovery, and rehabilitation of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and epilepsy. These findings underscore the evolving priorities and global relevance of SDR.",

    "title": "A Systems Biology Perspective on Childhood ADHD: Neurochemical Dysregulation, Brain‐Behavior Interactions, and Emerging Therapeutics",
    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental condition that typically manifests during childhood. Its symptoms manifest much earlier—often before the age of seven. With the disorder's continuous patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness, it gets in the way of academic, social, and occupational performance. Individuals affected by ADHD are found among all age groups, though its presentation may change over time. The mechanisms of ADHD seem to be very complex and multifactorial and include disturbances within neuroanatomical structures, neurochemical systems, and developmental trajectories. These influences create the characteristic behavior and cognitive profiles of an individual with ADHD that substantiate the heterogeneity of the disorder. This review will be centered on biology and development regarding ADHD, with contributions from modern scientific research. It will also delve into novel pharmacological therapeutic approaches for the management of ADHD.",

    "title": "Bridging the gap: a cross-sectional study on knowledge and awareness of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder among students at a public university",
    "abstract": "BackgroundAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects academic and social performance. Despite increasing mental health awareness, university students including those in healthcare disciplines often have limited understanding of ADHD. This study aimed to assess the levels of ADHD-related knowledge and awareness among students at a public university in Saudi Arabia.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted at King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia, from February to July 2025. A total of 330 undergraduate students were selected using a non-probability stratified purposive sampling technique. Data were collected using an online questionnaire assessing sociodemographics, ADHD knowledge (9 items), and awareness (11 items). Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify associated factors (p &lt; 0.05).ResultsAmong 330 students, 174 (52.7%) had good knowledge and 117 (35.4%) had good awareness of ADHD. Healthcare students had higher knowledge (78.0% vs. 26.5%), but awareness remained low in both groups (37.5% vs. 33.3%), highlighting gaps that may impede early recognition and support for students with ADHD. Notably, 45.5% of students including 36.3% of healthcare and 54.9% of non-healthcare students believed ADHD could be diagnosed through a blood test, reflecting persistent misconceptions. Lower GPA and reliance on social media were associated with poorer knowledge and awareness, while female gender and advanced academic year predicted better knowledge. These findings underscore the need for targeted educational interventions and evidence-based awareness campaigns to improve ADHD literacy and facilitate timely identification and support.ConclusionThis study revealed notable gaps in ADHD knowledge and awareness among university students. While healthcare students showed higher theoretical knowledge, practical awareness was low across groups. Better knowledge was associated with higher GPA, academic discipline, and access to professional information. Targeted educational strategies such as workshops, case-based learning, digital resources, and evidence-based campaigns are recommended to enhance ADHD literacy, correct misconceptions, and foster supportive university environments.",

Participants completed an online questionnaire assessing sociodemographic information, caregiver stress, mental health, and self-efficacy.\nResults\nThe average caregiver stress score was 21.56 (SD = 10.82), with 39.4% reporting severe stress levels. Mental health assessments indicated that 53.1% of caregivers were classified as flourishing. In terms of self-efficacy, 49.4% demonstrated high levels of self-efficacy. Significant negative correlations were found between caregiver stress and mental health (r = −0.343, p < 0.001), and between stress and self-efficacy (r = −0.269, p = 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that increased stress had a negative influence on self-efficacy (B = −0.091, p = 0.049), while improved mental health was positively correlated with self-efficacy (B = 0.164, p < 0.001). Mediation analysis indicated that mental health mediates the relationship between caregiver stress and self-efficacy (indirect effect = −0.062, p = 0.046).\nConclusion\nCaregivers of children with ADHD experience significant stress that adversely affects their mental health and self-efficacy. Targeted interventions to support caregiver mental health and enhance self-efficacy are essential for improving caregiver well-being and the quality of care for children with ADHD.\nPractice implications\nThis study underscores the urgent need for interventions that address the mental health and self-efficacy of caregivers, integrating support into treatment plans to enhance coping strategies and resilience.",

    "title": "Challenges in amphetamine medication availability for individuals with ADHD: a narrative review of the current state of evidence",
    "abstract": "BackgroundAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting individuals across various age groups. Access to amphetamine (AMPH) stimulant is a critical component of evidence-based care for individuals with ADHD. In Saudi Arabia, despite clinical guidelines endorsing their use, the availability of AMPH-based stimulants remains limited.ObjectiveThis narrative review aims to explore the current regulatory and policy environment influencing AMPH medication availability for individuals diagnosed with ADHD in Saudi Arabia.MethodsA narrative review methodology was adopted following the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles guidelines. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EBSCO, and PsycINFO using defined search terms related to ADHD, psychostimulants, and Saudi Arabia. Additional grey literature from key regulatory bodies, such as the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA), the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the Saudi ADHD Society, was also reviewed. Thirteen articles and reports met the eligibility criteria and were included for qualitative synthesis.ResultsMethylphenidate is the predominant stimulant prescribed for ADHD, while AMPH-based medications, such as lisdexamfetamine, are under prescribed due to regulatory restrictions, limited formulary inclusion, and supply inconsistencies. Policy reports from national institutions highlight persistent barriers to AMPH access, despite their inclusion in recent clinical practice guidelines. Prescription trends suggest significant treatment gaps for AMPH stimulants.ConclusionThe available evidence suggests a likely shortfall in AMPH-based medications. in Saudi Arabia, despite global and local evidence supporting their efficacy. Our findings suggest the need for enhancing regulatory pathways regarding AMPH access and availability, which requires policy interventions targeting regulatory reform, formulary expansion, and improved awareness among AMPH prescribers.",

    "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Practitioner’s Perspective",
    "abstract": "Background/Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in Saudi Arabia, yet challenges remain in diagnosis and treatment accessibility. This study examined healthcare practitioners’ clinical approaches to ADHD diagnosis and management in Saudi Arabia and identified gaps in practice. Methods: This cross-sectional study included healthcare practitioners working in various healthcare settings across Saudi Arabia. The sample included psychiatrists, pediatricians, psychologists, and other relevant specialists. Clinical practices regarding ADHD diagnosis, the use of ADHD screening tools, adherence to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, treatment strategies, medication prescription protocols, and reported challenges were investigated. Results: A total of 43 licensed healthcare practitioners with a minimum of 2 years of clinical experience managing ADHD participated. Among participants, 81.4% were psychiatrists, and 53.5% managed ADHD cases in children/adolescents exclusively. Approximately 86.0% of the sample used screening tools, with the Vanderbilt Assessment Scale being the most used (67.6%). However, only 55.8% addressed all 18 DSM-5 ADHD symptoms during the evaluation. Combined pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches (74.4%) were preferred. Interestingly, only 7.0% prescribed amphetamine-based stimulants due to the lack of clear guidelines. Key barriers included a lack of early screening programs (65.1%), limited ADHD medication option availability (51.2%), and extended referral waiting lists (44.2%). Conclusions: Significant variability in ADHD diagnosis and treatment practices was evident among healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. Specifically, a large proportion of healthcare providers do not fully comply with the standard DSM-5 diagnosis criteria. Major barriers to ADHD diagnosis and treatment in Saudi Arabia include extended referral waiting lists, limited availability of psychostimulant medications, and standardized clinical guidelines. A national ADHD protocol must be advocated, and access to diverse treatment options should be improved.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric disorder that affects children’s ability to function and could be carried into adolescence and adulthood with a prevalence of approximately 66-85%. However, few studies have assessed the association between prenatal maternal stress and ADHD in children in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to assess the impact of adverse childhood experiences on parents of children with ADHD. This was a case-control study with a sample size of 180 mothers of children with ADHD diagnosed in a child psychiatric clinic at King Abdulaziz University Hospital from 2015 to 2020. We recruited 94 mothers of non-ADHD children for the control group. We investigated stress with a validated questionnaire using the Perceived Stress Scale and Adverse Childhood Experience questionnaire and considered ADHD symptoms as determined using the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale–revised (CPRS-R). The one-way ANOVA revealed a significant association (p=0.002) between multiple early-life traumas and elevated adult stress. Mothers with ADHD children affected severely by past traumas displayed significantly higher stress (p&lt;0.05), unlike the control group, which showed no notable link between PSS levels, ACE questionnaire scores, or the effect of past experiences on maternal health (p>0.05). Of note, mothers of children with ADHD had higher levels of stress than control participants. Boys had a higher prevalence (67.8%) of ADHD than girls.",

    "title": "Effects of Mindfulness E-Activities on Academic Resilience in ADD/ADHD Students",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate how students with attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) feel about their academic prospects after engaging in mindfulness-based online activities. The study aimed to identify the effect of e-activities based on mindfulness on the academic buoyancy of students with ADHD. The study employed a semi-experimental approach to investigate the impact of e-activities based on mindfulness on enhancing the academic buoyancy of university students diagnosed with ADHD. The participants were 50 hyperactive and distracted students. On an achievement test, they scored over 60 on the self-estimation scale for adults with ADHD. Two experimental groups were randomly assigned. Twenty-five are the electronic activity group and 25 are the control group. The study found that there were statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group and the control group in the post-measurement in academic buoyancy in favor of the experimental group. Also, the study found that there are statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group in academic buoyancy in the post and follow-up measurements in favor of the follow-up measurement. The results can help those in charge of university education to take advantage of e-activities to improve the academic buoyancy of these students. Also, providing e-activities that can be used with students with ADHD to overcome academic problems they face and improve their academic level.",

    "title": "Evaluation of General Public Awareness, Knowledge, and Attitude Towards Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in the Riyadh Region of Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Background Attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a global prevalence of around 5% among children and adolescents. Despite increasing diagnoses, public knowledge about ADHD remains limited, contributing to stigma and delayed care. In Saudi Arabia, evidence on community awareness and attitudes is sparse. Objective This study assessed the awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and selected practices related to ADHD among adults in the Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross‑sectional survey was conducted from July 2024 to January 2025 using a self‑administered online questionnaire distributed via WhatsApp. Adults ≥18 years residing in Riyadh and able to read Arabic or English were invited. The instrument included four demographic questions and 23 items assessing knowledge (multiple choice) and attitudes (Likert scale). Knowledge scores were categorized as poor (75%). Attitude scores were classified as negative (75%). Practice questions on help‑seeking and information sources were analyzed descriptively. Data were analyzed using SPSS, and normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Because knowledge and attitude scores were non‑normally distributed, Mann‑Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H tests were used to compare groups, and Spearman’s correlation was used to assess associations. Results A total of 573 adults participated in the survey (response above the calculated sample of 385). Most were aged 18-25 years (60.2%) and were male (63%). Approximately 75% had previously heard of ADHD, but only 23.9% recognized it as a lifelong condition. Although 79.4% and 77.1% correctly identified inattention and hyperactivity as core symptoms, respectively, only 42.4% recognized impulsivity. Genetic factors were acknowledged by 61.1%, and 80.5% endorsed behavioral and pharmacological management. The mean (± SD) knowledge score was 6.48 ± 1.39. Out of the 573 participants, 49.9% showed poor knowledge, 48.9% showed moderate knowledge, and only 1.2% showed good knowledge. The attitude domain mean score was 39.9 ± 4.19 (range 13-55); 36.8% had a positive attitude, 62.8% had a neutral attitude, and 0.3% had a negative attitude. Most respondents believed that treatment and parenting skills improved outcomes, yet many hesitated to support inclusion of ADHD children in mainstream schools. Regarding practice, 55.7% had sought information about ADHD, 33.7% knew where to seek help, and 43.6% had interacted with someone with ADHD. The most common information source was the internet (78.7%), followed by friends/family (35.1%). Knowledge and attitude scores were positively correlated (rs = 0.165, p < 0.001). Higher education, female gender, and previous exposure to ADHD were associated with higher knowledge and more positive attitudes (p < 0.05). Conclusion Despite widespread awareness of ADHD, substantial gaps exist in public understanding of its symptoms, chronicity, and etiology. Attitudes were generally neutral, with reluctance toward full educational inclusion. Targeted educational initiatives and public campaigns are necessary to improve knowledge and foster supportive attitudes toward individuals with ADHD in Saudi Arabia.",

This study proposes a mediation model to test whether executive function plays a mediating role between central auditory processing and children’s PBs. A total of 120 participants took part in the study. Structural equation modeling was used to test whether executive function plays a mediating role between central auditory processing and children’s PBs. The results of this study show that executive function has a significant mediating effect between central auditory processing and PBs, and the mediating effect accounts for 30% of the total effect. Therefore, central auditory processing can not only directly affect children’s PB but also affect PBs by affecting executive function.",

    "title": "Exploring Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms in Patients With Atopic Dermatitis by Disease Severity: Cross-Sectional Analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting a significant percentage of the global population. Emerging research suggests a potential link between AD and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies within the Saudi Arabian population examining this association. Objective This study aims to determine the prevalence of ADHD among patients with AD in Saudi Arabia and to explore potential associations with demographic and clinical factors. Methods In this cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted between May and November 2024, 419 patients with AD were recruited from various hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Children were screened for ADHD symptoms using the ADHD Rating Scale-5, while adults were assessed with the Adult Self-Report Scale. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the influence of AD severity, age, gender, nationality, and BMI on the likelihood of ADHD symptoms. Results A total of 419 patients with AD were included, of whom 234 (55.8%) were children and 185 (44.2%) were adults; 239 (57%) were female and 360 (85.9%) were Saudi nationals. ADHD symptoms were identified in 84 (20%) patients, with a slightly higher prevalence among children (49/234, 20.9%) compared to adults (35/185, 18.9%; P=.61). No significant associations were found between ADHD symptoms and gender, nationality, BMI, or AD severity in either age group. Moderate to severe AD was more common among adults (48/185, 25.9%) than children (42/234, 17.9%; P=.048). Conclusions This study found that 20% of patients with AD screened positive for ADHD symptoms, with slightly higher rates in children than adults. No significant associations were observed between ADHD symptoms and gender, nationality, BMI, or AD severity. Although no significant clinical predictors were identified, the findings emphasize the need for ADHD screening in patients with AD, particularly in regions with high AD prevalence. Future longitudinal studies should explore underlying mechanisms and assess how managing one condition may influence the other.",

    "title": "Exploring Sleep Patterns of Children with ADHD: Mothers’ Perspectives in Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Context: ADHD, a neuro-developmental disorder, is characterized by core psychopathological features including inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Sleep disturbances are commonly observed among children with ADHD, resulting in heightened consequences such as compromised impulse control, difficulties in sustaining attention, and long-term impacts on academic performance, social interactions, and overall well-being. Aim: Explore the sleep patterns of children with ADHD from their mothers’ perspectives in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A quantitative, cross-sectional research methodology was employed in this study, with a sample comprising 103 mothers whose children have been affected by ADHD. Data for the study was obtained through the utilization of online structured questionnaires as the primary data collection tool. Results: The study reveals that more than half of the children, specifically 58%, fell within the 6-12-year-old age range, boys constituted the predominant group, accounting for 74% of the children. 18% of mothers reported their children usually had sleeping problems, 49% reported their children had sleeping problems. 87% of mothers do not know about ADHD disorder, also 44% of them do not know about sleep problems. In terms of maternal interventions, a significant proportion of participants, namely 89%, took proactive measures, such as reading stories (89%), maintaining consistent sleep schedules, and creating a serene environment, as reported by 74% of the participants. The study identified several challenges associated with sleep, with bedtime resistance being the most reported issue at 74%. Conclusion: A significant number of mothers reported that their children with ADHD often experience significant sleep disturbances. This finding is particularly evident in boys aged 6 to 12, who are more susceptible to both ADHD symptoms and related sleep issues. Addressing these sleep challenges is crucial for improving their overall well-being. Parents need to understand the relationship between sleep disturbances and ADHD to implement healthy sleep habits. Interventions such as reading bedtime stories, co-sleeping, and adjusting head positions can be beneficial.",

A total of 160 participants aged 4–6 years (mean = 5.01 and SD = 3.22) were included in the analyses. Normally distributed quantitative data were described using (M ± SD). Multivariate hierarchical regression analysis was used to further verify the mediating effect of different dimensions of executive function between motor coordination ability and core symptoms of children with ADHD. The bias-corrected nonparametric percentile Bootstrap method was used to test the multiple mediation model. This study found that the balance ability of children with ADHD significantly and negatively predicts the severity of core symptoms of attention deficit. the manual dexterity score of children with ADHD was negatively correlated with the attention deficit score, the aiming and catching score was negatively correlated with the working memory factor score, the balance score was negatively correlated with the attention deficit score. In terms of executive function, the inhibition, and working memory factor scores of children with ADHD were positively correlated with the attention deficit score, and the inhibition factor score was positively correlated with the hyperactivity/impulsivity score. The results show that the total mediating effect of the four factors of executive function is significant, accounting for 57.37% of the total effect.",

    "abstract": "Background and objective Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder affecting children's academic and social performance. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and misconceptions of primary school teachers in the Qassim region regarding ADHD. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2024 to October 2024 involving 381 primary school teachers in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire, which included demographic information and a 36-item ADHD knowledge assessment. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Most participants were female (58.8%, n=224) and aged between 41 and 50 (47%, n=147). Most of the teachers had more than 10 years of experience (76.4%, n=291) and taught students in fourth to sixth grades (46.5%, n=177). Overall, 87.4% (n=333) of teachers had heard of ADHD, with social media being the most common source of information (39.6%, n=151). Teachers had moderate knowledge of ADHD symptoms (52.67%, n=201), but general information (29.27%, n=211) and awareness of treatment options (32.87%, n=125) were limited. Significant differences in knowledge were found based on gender, age, experience, and the type of school, with female teachers and those in private schools having higher knowledge levels. Misconceptions, particularly about treatment, were widespread, with many teachers believing in ineffective interventions like dietary changes (87.9%, n=334). Conclusions While teachers in the Qassim region are aware of ADHD, their overall knowledge remains insufficient, especially regarding treatment methods. Providing training programs is essential to enhance teachers' understanding and improve ADHD management in schools.",

Exploratory factor analysis was used to reanalyze the structure of the scale, and selected the Empathy scale to test the structural validity of the revised QCAE scale. The QCAE was revised among Saudi children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. After revision, the scale finally retained 17 items, which were divided into three dimensions: perspective taking, online simulation, and emotional response. In general, the scale has a moderate number of items and no reverse scoring items. Various indicators show that the three-factor structure is more suitable for children than the four-factor or five-factor structure of other groups.",

Recent concerns suggest a potential link between increased screen time and the manifestation of ADHD symptoms. This study examined the relationship between screen time and ADHD-related symptoms in neurotypical children aged 3–18 years in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected through an online questionnaire completed by caregivers, focusing on screen time habits, ADHD-related symptoms (measured using the SNAP-IV scale), and potential confounders. A total of 324 children participated, with a slight male predominance (52.2%) and a median age of 9.07 years. Most of the children were Saudi nationals (97.5%) and resided in urban areas (70.7%). Using screens for more than 5 h was associated with higher total SNAP-IV scores. Multivariate analysis revealed that unrestricted screen time, related disorders, and lower maternal education were strongly associated with higher SNAP-IV scores. This study revealed a notable association between screen time characteristics, sociodemographic factors, and ADHD-related symptom severity in children in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.",

Collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26, JASP 0.18.3.0 software, and MedCalc 22.030 statistical software. Results: The ASRS-5-AR demonstrated strong internal consistency, with all six items showing significant positive correlation with the total score (.675–.735). Results of confirmatory factor analysis revealed a goodness-of-fit coefficient of 0.983 for the one-factor model and McDonald’s omega, Cronbach’s α, and Spearman-Brown coefficients of 0.786, 0.788, and 0.724, respectively. In addition, the findings revealed statistically significant differences in self-reported ADHD symptoms based on age ( F = 18.68; p &lt; .001), level of education ( F = 2.61; p &lt; .05), and marital status ( F = 22.30; p &lt; .001). However, there were no significant differences in self-reported ADHD symptoms between males and females ( t = 0.625; p > .05) or Saudi and non-Saudi participants ( t = 0.409; p > .05) or based on region of residence ( t = 2.19; p > .05). Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the psychometric properties of the ASRS-5-AR within a large sample of adults in Saudi Arabia. The findings demonstrate acceptable reliability of the ASRS-5-AR within this population. While these findings suggest the ASRS-5-AR may be a useful tool for initial assessment, further research is crucial. Future studies should focus on establishing accurate cutoff scores by comparing a general population sample with a clinically diagnosed sample of adults with ADHD in Saudi Arabia. This will allow for a more accurate evaluation of the scale’s utility in identifying individuals who may require further clinical assessment.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to investigate the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and emotional behavioral problems, with focus on studying the mediating effect of executive function. A total of 240 children with ADHD aged 6–10 years old participated. They all met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition. SPSS 26.0 was used for statistical analysis. Mean interpolation was used to interpolate missing values of a small number of questionnaire items. One-way analysis of variance was used for comparison between multiple groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used for correlation between variables. The results of this study showed that inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity scores of children with ADHD were positively correlated with the scores of emotional and behavioral problems (EBPs), that is, the more severe the attention deficit and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms were, the more severe the EBPs were. The hyperactivity-impulsivity score of children with ADHD positively predicted their behavioral regulation index (BMI) and metacognition index (MI) scores. The BMI score positively predicted the emotional and behavioral problem scores of children with ADHD, while the MI score had no statistically significant predictive effect on the emotional and behavioral problem scores of children with ADHD. These findings suggest that interventions targeting executive function—particularly behavioral regulation—may help mitigate emotional and behavioral difficulties in children with ADHD.",

    "title": "The impact of technology use on cognitive development and lexical attrition in L1 and L2 among younger students with ADHD: Opportunities and challenges",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The widespread integration of technology in education offers both exciting opportunities and significant challenges, particularly for learners with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While digital tools can provide interactive and personalized learning experiences, ADHD students face cognitive difficulties that may impair their ability to retain vocabulary in both first (L1) and second (L2) languages. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the complex relationship between ADHD, technology use, and lexical attrition, focusing on how working memory deficits, fragmented attention, and cognitive overload contribute to vocabulary loss. It introduces the Cognitive-Behavioral Technology Interaction (CBTI) Framework to explain these interactions and explore how technology can be optimized to mitigate its negative effects. METHODS: A conceptual analysis was conducted, integrating cognitive theories such as Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), Monitor Theory, and the Working Memory Model (WMM). The study synthesizes existing research on ADHD and lexical attrition, particularly within digital learning environments, to develop structured recommendations for improving vocabulary retention. RESULTS: Findings suggest that digital environments characterized by multitasking and rapid stimuli exacerbate vocabulary loss in ADHD learners. However, when used strategically, technological interventions such as spaced repetition systems (SRS) can enhance vocabulary retention by reintroducing words at optimal intervals. Structured, distraction-free learning environments were identified as essential for supporting ADHD students’ cognitive needs. CONCLUSION: The study underscores the need for collaboration between educators and healthcare providers to design effective, structured technological interventions for ADHD learners. By implementing targeted strategies, technology can shift from a challenge to a supportive tool for language retention and improved educational outcomes.",

    "title": "The Role of Perceived Social Support in the Association Between Stress and Creativity Self‐Efficacy Among Adolescents With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) face significant challenges related to stress, inattention and impulsivity, which can impair their creativity self‐efficacy. Social support is a critical protective factor that mitigates stress and enhances resilience, yet its role in fostering creativity self‐efficacy among adolescents with ADHD remains underexplored. Aim To examine the levels of stress, perceived social support and creativity self‐efficacy among adolescents with ADHD and to explore the mediating role of social support in the relationship between stress and creativity self‐efficacy. Methods A cross‐sectional study was conducted with 305 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD from six preparatory schools. Validated tools, including the Adolescence Stress Scale, Creative Self‐Efficacy Scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, were used to measure key variables. Data were analysed using Pearson correlation and mediation analysis. Results Stress was negatively correlated with CSE ( r = −0.791, p &lt; 0.001), while perceived social support positively correlated with creativity self‐efficacy ( r = 0.548, p &lt; 0.001). Social support significantly mediated the relationship between stress and creativity self‐efficacy, buffering the negative impact of stress on creativity ( B = −0.149, t = 7.987, p &lt; 0.001). Discussion The findings underscore the vital role of social support in alleviating stress and bolstering creativity self‐efficacy among adolescents with ADHD. Supportive relationships from family, peers, and mentors enhance confidence in creative abilities, creating a nurturing framework for resilience and innovation. Conclusion Perceived social support effectively mitigates the adverse effects of stress on creativity self‐efficacy, highlighting its importance in promoting adaptive outcomes for adolescents with ADHD. Implications for Practice Nursing interventions should prioritise strengthening social support systems for adolescents with ADHD. Educating families, schools and communities about the impact of social support can foster resilience, reduce stress and enhance creativity.",

    "abstract": "Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that continues into adulthood and is linked to significant academic, occupational, and psychological challenges. Medical students may be at heightened risk due to the cognitive and emotional demands of their training. However, regional data on adult ADHD symptoms in this population, particularly in northern Saudi Arabia, remain limited. Objective: to estimate the prevalence of probable adult ADHD symptoms among medical students at the University of Tabuk and to examine the associated sociodemographic, academic, and health-related factors. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between 15 May and 5 June 2025 among randomly selected Saudi medical students (years 2–6) at the University of Tabuk. The validated Arabic version of the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) was used to screen for probable ADHD. A positive screen was defined as ≥4 flagged items. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed using SPSS v29. Results: Of the 219 respondents (60.3% male; mean age: 21.6 years), 23.3% screened positive for probable adult ADHD. Symptom frequency peaked in the third (40.0%) and fourth (35.6%) academic years and was lowest among sixth-year students (11.4%) (p = 0.012). A strong association was observed between positive ADHD screening and self-reported psychiatric disorders (p < 0.001). No statistically significant associations were found for gender, income, GPA, marital status, or academic phase. Conclusions: Nearly one in four medical students at the University of Tabuk exhibited symptoms suggestive of adult ADHD, a prevalence markedly higher than global estimates and consistent with regional trends. The association with psychiatric morbidity and the mid-programme peak suggests a need for proactive screening, mental health support, and academic accommodations. Universities can translate these findings into practice by instituting routine ADHD screening, offering flexible assessment accommodations, embedding peer-mentoring programmes, and strengthening on-campus mental-health referral pathways.",

    "abstract": "Research and clinical practice have explored various applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study aimed to understand the current landscape and trends in AI-ADHD research. Data were extracted from the Scopus database via search terms generated from the MeSH database and analyzed via the VOSviewer and Bibliometrix platforms. The search strategy and selection of the studies followed the PRISMA guidelines. The dataset used in the study includes 2,064 records from 796 journals, covering research published between 1978 and 2024. AI-ADHD has experienced significant growth in scientific production in recent years. The most prolific journals are Neuroimage, Human Brain Mapping, and Neuroimage Clinical. The United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Germany are the most prolific countries. The most cited documents on AI-ADHD include diagnostic tools, attentional networks, altered brain activity, cortical maturation, working memory impairment, and the development of functional brain networks in children. The most prevalent keywords included “ADHD,” “functional magnetic resonance imaging,” “machine learning” and “neuroimaging.” Thematic evolution revealed a shift from ADHD to related topics such as bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, and executive functions. The intellectual structure identified distinct thematic clusters, classified as basic (functional connectivity, epilepsy, machine learning), niche (reliability, white matter) and motor (Tourette syndrome, case reports). The emerging themes included natural language processing, deep learning, and mental health. Researchers and practitioners can use current findings to advance the understanding of ADHD, improve diagnostic precision, and develop effective interventions that positively impact individuals with ADHD.",

    "title": "Validation of the Arabic ADHD rating Scale-5 for adolescents in Saudi Arabia using structural equation modeling",
    "abstract": "There is an increasing number of studies in the literature on the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), indicating its high prevalence. This study sought to investigate the reliability of the ADHD Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS-5) for adolescents in Saudi Arabia as a valid screening tool for this age group. Furthermore, it aimed to calculate the cutoff score for screening for ADHD in the Saudi environment to provide a reliable tool that helps specialists assessing for ADHD among adolescents.This study applied a descriptive approach to verify the reliability of the ADHD-RS-5 in the Saudi environment. The sample consisted of 477 parents and 1284 teachers of Saudi and non-Saudi adolescents (aged 13 to below 20 years) residing in Riyadh, Makkah, and the Eastern Province. Both forms of the ADHD-RS-5 (home and school) were applied to the sample under supervision of the Saudi ADHD Society. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26), JASP (version 0.18.3.0), and MedCalc statistical software (version 22.030).Confirmatory factor analysis results revealed acceptable goodness-of-fit indicators for the home and school forms of the ADHD-RS-5. Pearson’s correlation coefficients for both forms were found to be positive and statistically significant (p > 0.001); the coefficient values ranged between 0.669 and 0.921 for the home form and between 0.795 and 0.954 for the school form. In addition, Cronbach’s α coefficient values ​​for inattention, hyperactivity, impairment, and the scale’s total score for the home form were 0.919, 0.913, 0.952, and 0.952, respectively, while for the school form were 0.955, 0.944, 0.969, and 0.981, respectively. Cronbach’s α coefficient values ​​were close to the values ​​of the McDonald’s ω for the home form (0.920, 0.914, 0.953, and 0.965, respectively) and for the school form (0.955, 0.939, 0.968, and 0.977, respectively). These results indicate that the ADHD-RS-5, both home and school forms, and its subscales have good Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω coefficients. The findings also showed that the prevalence of ADHD among adolescents in Saudi Arabia was 5.03% based on the home form and 5.92% based on the school form. The cutoff value to screen for ADHD in adolescents in the Saudi environment for the home form was > 30, with a sensitivity of 91.67% (95% confidence level [CL] = 73–99), a specificity of 86.98% (95% CL = 83.5–89.9), and 81.29% accuracy. However, the cutoff score in the school form was > 28, with a sensitivity of 94.74% (CL = 81.1–98.5), a specificity of 89.65% (CL = 87.8–91.3), and 86.46% accuracy. The current findings suggest that the Arabic version of the ADHD-RS-5-AR has strong psychometric properties, with good indicators of internal consistency and reliability. This study provides valuable information for the national ADHD survey planned to be carried out in 2024–2025. It will also support the preventive efforts in Saudi Arabia and Saudi Vision 2030 in achieving its goals related to the quality of life and well-being of community members of all ages as well as the goals of sustainable development.",

    "title": "Accurate Identification of Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Using Machine Learning Approaches",
    "abstract": "The identification of ADHD is laden with a great number of challenges and obstacles. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, there is a possibility that this will have adverse impact on their health. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that often emerge in infancy. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in sustaining attention, concentrating, and regulating behavior. Therefore, using artificial intelligence approaches for early detection is very important for reducing the increase in disease. The goal of this research is to find out an accurate model that could differentiate between those who have ADHD and those who do not have it by making use of the method of pattern recognition. The research project was composed of a combination of event-related potential data from people who had been diagnosed with ADHD, in addition to a control group that was made up of people who did not have ADHD. This research presents novel machine learning models based on decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), using dataset collected from ADHD patients for the purpose of training. Significant performance outcomes have been seen in the context of the SVM which has achieved a high accuracy rate of 91%. MLP has demonstrated an accuracy rate of 89%. Furthermore, the RF model has shown an accuracy rate of 87%. Finally, the DT model revealed accurate results up to 78%. The aforementioned results highlight the effectiveness of the utilized methods and the ability of modern computational frameworks in attaining substantial levels of accuracy in the diagnosis and categorization of ADHD.",

    "title": "ADHD Diagnosis Using Text Features and Predictive Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder characterized by difficulties in controlling movement, impulsivity, and maintaining attention. Furthermore, it is important to note that this developmental disease is characterized by disparities and inconsistencies in performance and aptitude and can persist into adulthood manifesting in many forms and symptoms. ADHD typically manifests in childhood and frequently continues into adulthood, affecting various aspects of life such as academic and occupational performance, social interactions, and emotional well-being. The aim of this research work is to develop a diagnostic and detection system for ADHD by utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques which are applied to social media textual data obtained from the Reddit platform. The DL techniques included neural networks such as gated recurrent unit and long short-term memory. The proposed methodology includes the gathering of dataset, preparation of data, extraction of features using term frequency-inverse document frequency, classification of models, and study of assessment metrics to assess the performance of the used models. The random forest model revealed the best performance compared to the other models analyzed, with an F1-score of 84% and an area under curve of 81%. The aforementioned results underscore the capability of ML in detecting ADHD-related data on social media platforms, thus providing significant contributions to the fields of study and healthcare.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Models to Predict Disability for Mental Health Disorders",
    "abstract": "Early detection of mental health disorders allows specialists to provide more effective interventions, thereby improving the patient’s overall well-being. Mental health refers to the whole state of an individual’s psychological, emotional, and social well-being. Prompt detection of signs of mental disorders is essential for prompt intervention and the mitigation of recurrent symptoms and impairments. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been used to aid mental health professionals, such as psychiatrists and psychologists, in making decisions by analyzing medical records and patients’ behavioral data. This research identified and evaluated the performance of machine learning algorithms, namely K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and long short-term memory (LSTM), in detecting mental health conditions based on many accuracy criteria. A mental health disorder dataset was collected from Kaggel. The results of the implemented algorithms demonstrated that the RF approach attained an accuracy of 100%, while the KNN model scored an accuracy of 95%. The LSTM model achieved 99% accuracy with respect to the accuracy metric. The RF model attains an area under the curve of 100%. This system intends to use AI model methodologies to identify and predict mental health disorders at an early stage. This system is a well-established and effective tool that utilizes AI algorithms to accurately detect and diagnose various mental health illnesses, thus assisting in the decision-making process.",

    "title": "Assessment of the Quality of Life and Family Function in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Caregivers in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Background Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurobehavioral disorder in children and teenagers. The condition is debilitating, affecting numerous cognitive and behavioral processes and leading to substantial long-term consequences. Affected individuals, their families, and society as a whole bear a heavy functional, psychological, and financial cost. Aim The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) among parents of children with ADHD diagnoses, as well as the burden and level of dysfunction in the family. Additionally, to ascertain the sociodemographic factors that influence these issues. Methods This cross-sectional study used an online survey to collect data from caregivers of children with a confirmed diagnosis of any type of ADHD who were exhibiting symptoms before the age of seven, speaking Arabic fluently and consented to take part in the study. The Arabic version questionnaire of the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) was used to assess the QOL, and the Zarit Burden Interview questionnaire was employed to assess the degree of the experienced burden. Participants were recruited by a systematic random sampling method. Results A total of 103 ADHD caregivers were included in the study. A total of 89 out of 103 (86.4%) participants reported having various degrees of burden. There was a significant relation between the marital status of the caregiver and the degree of burden (p=0.024). Divorced caregivers were (4, 57.1%) severely burdened. Ninety out of 103 participants (87.4%) reported having dysfunctional families, and the majority of them (60, 60.1%) reported moderate family dysfunction. All quality-of-life domains were negatively impacted, with the environmental domain experiencing the most disruption. The overall four subdomains of QOL did not differ significantly with various sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusion There was a high prevalence of burden and family dysfunction among caregivers of ADHD children. Marital status was associated with a significant impact on the level of burden. In addition, there was a detrimental influence on every aspect of quality of life, with the environmental domain suffering the most. It is important to take into account family therapy and other interventions that strengthen caregivers' and families' relationships.",

    "title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dental traumatic injuries: a systemic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess whether individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit a higher prevalence of traumat- ic dental injuries (TDIs) compared to those with- out ADHD through a systematic review and me- ta-analysis of the existing literature.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A search strat- egy using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) vocabulary was employed for a comprehen- sive search across various databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Li- brary, and Embase. The Joanna Briggs Institute Summary was utilized for data collection. Addi- tionally, quality assessment, meta-analysis, and bias control were conducted to ensure the reli- ability of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed to consolidate the findings of the individual studies.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of TDIs among indi- viduals with ADHD ranged from 9.6% to 68.2%, while in the healthy control group, it ranged from 0.8% to 44.7%. The meta-analysis findings revealed that individuals with ADHD had 1.98 times higher odds (OR = 1.98, ranging from 1.51 to 2.59 with 95% CI) of experiencing TDIs com- pared to individuals without ADHD.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest a significant association between ADHD and an increased risk of TDIs. Individ- uals with ADHD were found to be nearly twice as likely to experience TDIs compared to those without ADHD. Efforts should not only be direct- ed towards improving the oral health of this vul- nerable group of individuals, but also health- care practitioners need to be provided with op- portunities to create awareness and implement preventive measures to mitigate the risk of TDIs among individuals with ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Atomoxetine is a psychostimulant drug used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in people with autism. Herein, eco-friendly fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were synthesized using black-eyed pea beans and characterized for the purpose of quantifying atomoxetine in pharmaceutical capsules and human plasma. The selectivity of these CQDs towards atomoxetine was improved by functionalizing their surface with an atomoxetine-tetraphenylborate ion complex. The quantification of atomoxetine is based on measuring the fluorescence quenching of the functionalized CQDs in response to varying concentrations of atomoxetine. The Stern-Volmer plot was employed to investigate the mechanism through which atomoxetine quenches the fluorescence intensity of the CQDs. The outcomes indicated a dynamic quenching mechanism. The applied method was optimized and validated in compliance with ICH requirements, resulting in excellent linearity across the concentration range of 50–800 ng/mL. The developed method was successfully used to quantify atomoxetine in pharmaceutical dosage form and human plasma with acceptable accuracy and precision outcomes. In addition, the method was applied for clinical pharmacokinetic study of atomoxetine in the plasma of children diagnosed with both autism and ADHD. Atomoxetine was rapidly absorbed after a single oral dose of 10 mg, reaching maximum concentration within two hours and having a half-life (t1/2) of 3.11 h. Moreover, the method demonstrates a notable degree of eco-friendliness, as evidenced by two greenness evaluation metrics; Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and Analytical GREEnness (AGREE).",

    "title": "Development of fluorescence probe for spectrofluorimetric determination of viloxazine hydrochloride in pharmaceutical form and rat plasma; additional pharmacokinetic study",
    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological condition frequently identified in early childhood and frequently co-occurs with other neuropsychological disorders, particularly autism. Viloxazine hydrochloride, a non-stimulant medication, has recently gained approval for treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. This paper describes the first spectrofluorimetric method for precisely measuring the content of viloxazine in pharmaceutical capsules and rat plasma. This method employed NBD-Cl (4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) as a fluorescent probe, which transformed viloxazine in an alkaline environment into a remarkably sensitive fluorescent adduct. Upon excitation at 476 nm, this adduct becomes detectable at a wavelength of 536 nm. The method was validated using ICH criteria, revealing acceptable linearity across a concentration range of 200–2000 ng/ml and high sensitivity with LOD and LOQ values of 46.774 ng/ml and 141.741 ng/ml, respectively. This method was adeptly applied in a pharmacokinetic study of viloxazine in rat plasma following a single oral dose (10 mg/kg), yielding a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1721 ng/ml, achieved within 1.5 h. Furthermore, the environmental impact of the technique was assessed using two greenness assessment tools, revealing a notable level of eco-friendliness and sustainability.",

    "title": "Diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A deep learning approach",
    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant interest in the analysis and classification of brain dis-orders using electroencephalography (EEG). We presented machine learning and deep learning (DL) frameworks that integrate an EEG-based brain network with various DL models to diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). By incorporating an objective biomarker into the diagnostic process, the accuracy and effectiveness of diagnosis could be enhanced. We used public EEG datasets from 61 ADHD youngsters and 60 normally developing children. The raw EEG data underwent preprocessing, including the application of filters in clinically relevant frequency bands and notch filters. From the preprocessed EEG segments, statistical features (e.g., standard deviation, kurtosis) and spectral features (e.g., entropy) were extracted. Principal component analysis (PCA) and chi-square with PCA were used as feature selection methods to obtain the most useful features and keep them. The machine learning models achieved the highest accuracy result of 94.86% by utilizing support vector machines (SVM) with PCA features. Furthermore, integrating models combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and gated recurrent unit-Transformer (GRU-Transformer block) with Chi-square and PCA features achieved accuracies of 94.50% and 95.59%, respectively. The suggested framework demonstrated a wide range of applicability in addressing the identification of ADHD. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, comparisons were made with existing models, and the proposed system exhibited superior performance. We enhanced EEG-based analysis and categorization of ADHD by demonstrating the capabilities of advanced artificial intelligence models in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficacy.",

    "title": "Employing Elements of Virtual Reality to Enhance Social Skills Among Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Quasi Experimental Study",
    "abstract": "Children with ADHD fail to establish good relationships with others and practice undesirable behaviors that disturb those around them. Additionally, this disorder may create difficulties in social performance and adaptation to different life contexts. Nonetheless, in light of recent technological advancements, traditional education programs no longer cover deficiencies resulting from this disorder. It is also no longer attractive among children with ADHD. Therefore, in this research study, the researchers designed four Google Cardboard Virtual Reality (VR) applications that were developed with several domain experts' supervision to enhance four social skills (greeting back, waiting for a turn during an ordering, not interrupting others while talking, and cooperating) among children with ADHD which had the potential to help them integrate smoothly into society. A quasi-experimental study was conducted for one group in the Developmental and Behavioral Disorders Clinics and Centers in Maternity and Children's Hospital in Najran Region, Saudi Arabia. The results were promising and showed an improvement in the social skills of the participants with mild or moderate ADHD symptoms. In contrast, there was no improvement in social skills in participants with severe ADHD symptoms.",

Results: Stage 1 generated 382 research questions with 10 broad areas identified for example, co-occurring conditions and treatment, etc. The top 20 most important questions related to ADHD in women/girls, long-term medication use, non-pharmacological interventions, ADHD measurement/rating scales, and efficacy of emotional regulation interventions. Conclusion: These results can inform an ADHD research agenda which represents the views of the individuals from major ADHD professional groups internationally. Parallel work is needed focusing on research priorities from the perspective of ADHD consumers.",

    "title": "Evaluation of ADHD knowledge and awareness among healthcare college interns in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neuropsychiatric disorder, is common in children and can persist into adulthood. With or without hyperactivity, it involves chronic impulsivity and inattention. Despite being a widespread illness, there is little research on ADHD knowledge and awareness among health college interns in Riyadh, KSA. Therefore, this study examined health college interns’ knowledge and awareness in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered validated survey was used to gather demographics as well as knowledge and awareness scores in King Saud University, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Imam Mohammed ibn Saud, and Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman, and one private Almaarefa University. Results: This study included 322 health college interns aged 18–24; 55% were males. The Saudi Professional Practice Licensure Exams (SPPLE) were passed by 65.5% of participants from King Saud University and KSAU-HS, Riyadh’s leading medical and pharmaceutical universities. They are evenly split throughout the four GPA categories. The interns knowledgeable and aware of ADHD (scored ≥ 13 on a 20-scale score) constituted 68% of the interns. Interns who passed Saudi Professional Practice Licensure Exams graduated from pharmacy and medicine schools, and had ≥4.5 or more GPAs were more knowledgeable than other interns. Conclusion: As per our research, most health college interns in Riyadh were aware of ADHD; however, medical and pharmacy interns were more knowledgeable than others. This suggests that other health colleges should revamp their ADHD and neurological illness topics curricula.",

    "abstract": "Background\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental conditions in children, and can profoundly affect their social interactions, well-being, and relationships with parents, peers, and teachers.\nObjective\nThis study investigated the effectiveness of a social-play-based intervention programme in reducing ADHD symptoms in a sample of 67 Saudi boys aged 8–10 diagnosed with ADHD.\nMethods\nThe programme consisted of ten 60-minute sessions of play-based activities, delivered to the experimental group twice weekly for 5 weeks. The control group followed the usual school curriculum. Teachers and parents completed the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale–Revised: Short Form and Conners' Parent Rating Scale–Revised: Short Form for all participants at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up.\nResults\nThe experimental group showed a significant reduction in ADHD-associated behavioural problems over time, with moderate to large effect sizes. No significant changes over time were found for the control group. The results were maintained at a 2-month follow-up.\nConclusions\nWe recommend incorporating social-play-based activities and skill training into the school context. Reducing ADHD symptoms may improve children's academic performance and perspective on school.",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. This study investigates the quality of life (QoL) of parents of children with ADHD, the discrimination they encounter, and their sources of information about the disorder. This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire through Google Forms from March to April 2023. Study participants were recruited using a convenient sampling technique from patient records in 4 regions of Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was sent through commonly used social media. QoL was assessed through the validated Arabic version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument, Short Form questionnaire. A total of 100 participants were recruited for this study. Most of the participants were from the southern region (80%, n = 80), 66.0% (n = 66) were mothers, 66.0% (n = 66) were married and 64% (n = 64) had a college degree. The mean scores of the physical, psychological, mental, environmental, total scales, and general QoL were (57.18 ± 13.67, 62.58 ± 17.49, 63.33 ± 23.12, 23.07 ± 12.87, 51.54 ± 14.34, 3.69 ± 1.06, respectively). Half of the population studied experienced discrimination with no significant differences between mothers and fathers (64% vs 68%, P = .833). The main source of information on ADHD was the Internet (49%) followed by schools (11%), and relatives (10%). Fifty-four percent of the participants have participated in workshops or seminars on neurodevelopmental disorders and 39.0% believed that schools and institutions are sufficiently equipped to support children with ADHD. ADHD had a profound impact on the QoL of parents, with a substantial portion facing discrimination due to their child condition. Additionally, parents showed a strong desire to acquire more information about ADHD, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding and support surrounding this condition.",

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Children with Attention and Hyperactivity Deficit Disorder (ADHD) and those at risk of ADHD typically exhibit challenging behaviours that may disrupt the classroom environment and be frustrating for teachers. This study aimed to explore teachers’ experiences and emotions regarding teaching children with high levels of ADHD symptoms and their perceptions of what might help to meet their unmet support needs. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 primary educational practitioners for children aged between four and eight years in the UK. Interview scripts were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Six main themes and 8 subthemes were developed. These included: (1) ADHD behaviours can disrupt the learning environment; (2) teachers face practical demands on their expertise and particular skills; (3) managing ADHD behaviours can be overwhelming for teachers; (4) teachers and children may treat children with ADHD negatively, which can impact on children’s emotions and lead to labelling; (5) existing support for teachers is limited; and (6) teachers need more specific training about ADHD. Results: The analysis revealed that teachers working with children with externalising behaviours such as ADHD can feel overwhelmed. Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that teachers require more training in managing externalising behaviour in the classroom.",

However, the prevalence of maternal smoking, secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure during pregnancy, and ADHD in children within the Saudi Arabian context is not well-documented. Objective: To explore the prevalence of maternal smoking and SHS exposure during pregnancy among mothers of children diagnosed with ADHD and investigate exposure to smoking as a predictor of ADHD subtypes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 1, 2022, to February 28, 2023, using an online questionnaire. The study included 217 parents of children aged 4-17 years diagnosed with ADHD and without a family history of the disorder. Data on sociodemographic determinants, academic achievement, ADHD types, and maternal smoking habits during pregnancy were collected. Results: Among the mothers surveyed, 6.4% reported smoking during pregnancy, while 41% were exposed to SHS. The study found a predominance of the combined subtype of ADHD among the children. Logistic regression analysis revealed that families with monthly income &lt;10 000 SR were 2.6 times more likely to have a child with inattentive or hyperactive ADHD ( P ",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of the educational intervention on mothers’ knowledge, awareness, and communication difficulties experienced with their children and mothers’ capacity to successfully interact with their affected child before and after the intervention. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental research design was used. A total of 30 mothers and their children complaining of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder from four Dawadmi primary schools were included. Data were collected through a self-developed questionnaire from September 2023 to January 2024 after study acceptance by Shaqra University’s scientific deanship. Intervention prepared according to subjects’ needs and current scientific base and demonstrated in 10 sessions in schools. Results: Regarding mothers’ age, more than one-fourth of them (26.7%) ranged from 31 to 35 year old, and about a third (36.7%) had secondary education. Regarding mother’s job, about 76.7% do not work, and the majority of affected children (66.6%) were male, there were significant improvements in mothers’ knowledge pre- and postintervention also a significant improvement in mothers’ awareness about symptoms of poor attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity pre- and postintervention was found. Significant differences were found before and after the intervention regarding the impact of the intervention in decreasing mothers’ challenges. Conclusion: The study hypothesis was accepted, and the intervention improved mothers; knowledge, awareness, and communication challenges. The intervention should be conducted and followed up for a long period of time to manage all mother’s and children’s daily challenges, improve children’s daily activities, and stabilize effective communication patterns between children and their family members.",

    "abstract": "Background\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that not only impacts children's behavior, learning, and social interactions but also their quality of life. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may provide new opportunities to improve the ADHD symptoms and quality of life of children with ADHD, especially through customized play activities that address their specific needs.\nAims\nThis study examined the impact of AI-based play activities on the quality of life of 61 Saudi children aged between 8 and 12 years who had an ADHD diagnosis.\nMethods\nAI-based play activities intervention consisted of twelve 45-minute sessions, delivered to the experimental group over four weeks (three sessions per week). The control group did not receive any intervention. Children and parents completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) at pre-test, post-test and follow-up.\nResults and outcomes\nThe experimental group exhibited significant improvements in all dimensions and total scores of PedsQL, with moderate to large effect sizes. These improvements were not observed in the control group. The beneficial effects of the AI-based play activities were maintained at the 7-weeks follow-up.\nConclusions\nAI-based play interventions may enhance quality of life for children with ADHD, with sustained improvements observed after 7-weeks. Incorporating such interventions into educational and therapeutic settings could improve behavioral, social, and cognitive ADHD symptoms. Future research should explore broader applications and long-term effects of AI-based play activities interventions.",

    "title": "Knowledge and Attitude of Elementary School Teachers Towards ADHD in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Background: ADHD is typically affecting school performance, concentration, and self-control at school. Teachers are often the first ones to suspect ADHD in their students, because they are with them for most of the day and they know how normal students typically behave in classroom situations.\nObjectives: The aim of this study is to measure the knowledge level and to assess the attitude toward attention-deficit hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) among elementary school teachers in Saudi Arabia.\nMethodology: A cross-sectional study based on a structured questionnaire that was conducted on primary school teachers in Saudi Arabia during 2023-2024. The questionnaire contains 51 questions and is divided into three main parts. The first part is concerned with the social and personal data and contains 15 questions. The second part is composed of 24 questions and is focusing on the level of knowledge which might be high, moderate or low according to the score. The last part is to check the attitudes and contains 12 questions and according to the score the participant might have positive, fair or negative attitude. By using the following formula, n = (z)² p (1 – p) / d² the sample size is planned to be 384. SPSS (Statistical-Package of Social -Science) version 20 will be used to analyze the data. And the data will be written by using \"Microsoft Office Excel Software\".\nResult: The present study demonstrates a low level of knowledge among teachers regarding ADHD: about 94% had low level of knowledge. A positive association was found between knowledge level and the teachers' age, previous experience with ADHD and nationality (p value < 0.05). As regard attitude 96% demonstrated a positive attitude towards ADHD 1176\nConclusion: there is a low level of knowledge among teachers regarding ADHD, about 94% had low level of knowledge while a significant majority of 96% demonstrated a positive attitude towards ADHD.\nElementary school teachers should be trained in identifying ADHD symptoms as well as in behavioral management and academic interventions.",

    "title": "Mothering Children with ADHD: The Influence of Courtesy Stigma and Psychological Distress on Family Life of Saudi Mothers",
    "abstract": "An extensive body of research shows that mothers of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) endure a multitude of social and psychological difficulties, including discrimination, parenting stress, depression, and impaired family life, compared to mothers of neurotypical children. Research on Arab mothers of children with ADHD is limited, however. This study examined the influence of sociodemographic attributes, courtesy stigma, and psychological distress as predictors of family dynamics among 84 Saudi mothers. We used hierarchical multiple regression analysis to determine variance in family life scale accounted for by sociodemographic variables in Model (1) The same sociodemographic items with the addition of courtesy stigma and psychological distress were entered in Model (2) The first model (F (4, 84) = 2.50, p &lt;.05) accounted for 11% of the variance in the outcome variable, with educational level as the only significant predictor (β = − 0.28, p &lt;.001). In the second model (F (6, 84) = 10.25, p &lt;.001), courtesy stigma (β = 0.42, p &lt;.001) and psychological distress (β = 0.37, p &lt;.001) were the only two significant predictors (F = 8.67, p &lt;.001), accounting for 44% of the variance in the family life scores. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that higher levels of courtesy stigma and psychological distress are associated with greater strain in families of children with ADHD. The considerable difficulties that families with ADHD children undergo dictate enactment of family-centered interventions and a national comprehensive ADHD-stigma reduction program in Saudi Arabia that are attentive to maternal social and mental health.",

    "abstract": "This systematic literature review was conducted to examine the most studied neurodevelopmental disorders reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and explore public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Electronic literature databases such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar from May 2010 to May 2022. The literature was screened and assessed the quality of surveys of extracted 21 articles following the Best Practices for Survey and Public Opinion Research by the American Association for Public Opinion Research. Since 2010, the most studied neurodevelopmental disorders reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, with the prevalence of studies conducted in Central province, followed by Western province and the rest of Saudi Arabia in general. The analysis of questionnaires used showed that 20 studies were of high quality, and one was of medium quality. The narrative synthesis of included studies showed an overall lack of knowledge about autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, misconceptions and misunderstandings about these health conditions. More research is needed in all regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to contribute to the knowledge about mental health conditions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder children and their parents to inform policies and practical recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Background Enuresis, or bedwetting, is a common condition affecting millions of children worldwide. This can be a source of distress for both children and their families. Children, adolescents, and young adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at risk of developing enuresis. They have difficulties with executive functioning, including impulse control and emotional regulation. These difficulties may contribute to the development of enuresis, as individuals may struggle to recognize the urge to use the bathroom or have difficulty controlling their bladder during sleep.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric analysis of the Childhood Executive Functioning Inventory (CHEXI) in Saudi Arabian ADHD children using the Rasch model. The study included 210 children from both sexes(males and females). All participants were from Saudi Arabia. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to determine the dimensional structure of the scale. The Rasch Rating Scale Model (RSM) was used and implemented in the WINSTEPS v. 3.73 program. The results showed that the data, taken together, met the requirements of the RSM fit statistics. A good overall fit of persons and items to the model was found. Persons high rates of endorsement of definitely true on the CHEXI, as well as the most difficult items, are at the top of the map. No differences were found between the number of males and females in each of the three areas. The unidimensionality and local independence requirements were met. The levels of difficulty of the response categories are calibrated in ascending order as expected and in agreement with Andreich's scale model, and that all response categories are statistically appropriate according to the two scales of relevance, Infit and Outfit, where the statistics of the mean squares (Mnsq) for the fit of the categories did not exceed the limits of suitability. The thresholds for CHEXI are graded in difficulty and are almost equal in discrimination, and thus the assumption of the rating scale model is fulfilled.",

    "title": "Psychometric Properties of the Arabic Vanderbilt Children's ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (VADRS-A) in a Saudi Population Sample",
    "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to utilise Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to investigate the constructive validity of the Arabic translation of the Vanderbilt Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) Diagnostic Scale (VADRS-A) using its two versions, the Arabic Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale (VADPRS-A) and the Arabic Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Teacher Rating Scale (VADTRS-A). Method A descriptive research design was employed. Children were assessed by their parents and teachers, and a cluster sample of 1812 participants was chosen from many schools in Saudi Arabia, divided into two groups: parents (504) and teachers (1308) of children whose ages ranged between 5 to 12 years old. The VADPRS-A and VADTRS-A were administered to parents and teachers under the supervision of the Saudi ADHD Society. Results The results of the PCA of VADPRS-A found that the six factors saturate one general factor that explained (59%) of the total variance of the factor matrix with eigenvalues (3.540). Similarly, the PCA of VADTRS-A demonstrated that the five factors were saturated on a general factor that explained (69.20%) of the total variance of the factor matrix with eigenvalues (3.460). Also, the results indicate the high internal consistency of VADPRS-A and VADTRS-A, all factors correlated together and the total scores positively and significantly statistically (p>.001) correlation coefficients ranged between (0.296 to 0.843) for VADPRS-A, and ranges between (0.432 to 0.939) for VADTRS-A. Also, the Cronbach's α coefficient values for the six factors and total score of VADPRS-A were (.906, .925, .900, .896, .853, .872, .959) respectively, and these values are close to the values of the McDonald's ω for the factors and the total score were (.908, .923, .901, .871, .850, .877, .925) respectively. In the same way, Cronbach's α coefficients were (.967, .921, .914, .858, .948, .971) for all factors and the total score of VADTRS-A respectively, and these values are close to the values of the McDonald's ω (.968, .921, .919, .856, .943, .965) for all factors and the total score of VADTRS-A. In addition CFA for VADPRS-A and VADTRS-A models showed acceptable factor loading and good values of goodness-of-fit indices; CFI, TLI, RMSEA, IFI, and GFI (0.956, 0.942, 0.049, 0.956, 0.952) respectively for VADPRS-A model, and were (0.958, 0.932, 0.051, 0.963, 0.964) for VADTRS-A model, all of these were at an acceptable range. These results suggest a fit with the previous theoretical literature about VADPRS and VADTRS and DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria of ADHD. Conclusion These findings highlighted the good psychometric properties of VADRS-A in both its versions VADPRS-A and VADTRS-A in the Saudi environment. Due to these findings, we suggest utilising VADPRS-A and VADTRS-A during ADHD diagnosis in children 5-12 years old in Saudi Arabia, to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, and to help mitigate the risks of ADHD during subsequent developmental phases in children's lives.",

    "title": "Quality of Life Among Saudi Parents of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Cross-Sectional Study",
    "abstract": "Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children can adversely impact parental quality of life (QoL). However, limited research exists among families in Saudi Arabia, especially in understudied regions like Jazan. This study was designed to determine the QoL in parents of children with ADHD in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia from June 2023 to December 2023. Online questionnaires were used to collect data from parents of children with ADHD residing in the country. A structured questionnaire was developed in consultation with the National Institute for Children's Health Quality (NICHQ) guidelines. The total sample size was 276. The study participants were recruited through convenient non-random snowballing sampling where the promotion of the questionnaire web link aided in reaching the required sample size of the study. Participants aged more than 18 years, residents of the Jazan area, and both genders were included. R software was used for data analysis. Results The study, involving 275 participants, revealed that 45 (16%) children were diagnosed with ADHD by doctors, with a higher prevalence among males 36 (80%). The NICHQ scale identified ADHD in 50 (18%) participants, with the predominant subtypes being inattentive 28 (56%), hyperactive/impulsive 28 (56%), and combined 19 (38%). The median QoL score was 8.6, with good QoL reported by 51.27% of parents and poor QoL by 48.73%. Gender significantly influenced QoL (p < 0.01), with 57% of males and 43% of females reporting good QoL, while 61% of females and 39% of males reported poor QoL. Oppositional defiant symptoms were significantly associated with poorer QoL (p < 0.05). There was a notable alignment between ADHD diagnoses from parental reports and the NICHQ scale. Conclusions This cross-sectional study found that parents of children with ADHD behaviors, especially those exhibiting oppositional defiant symptoms, experienced significantly lower QoL, particularly in personal fulfillment and psychosocial well-being. The findings emphasize the need for culturally tailored psychosocial interventions in Saudi Arabia to improve parental coping and QoL, benefiting overall family well-being and child outcomes.",

    "title": "The Genetic Overlap of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Evidence of overlap is seen in the frequent co-occurrence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) within individuals or families. Recently, molecular genetic techniques, have begun to identify specific single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants linked to both ASD and ADHD. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the genetic overlap between ASD and ADHD to elucidate common genetic factors and mechanisms that contribute to both conditions. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple electronic databases and studies were included if they described the genetic associations between ADHD and ASD. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved through discussion. The significant overlap between ADHD and ASD is evident through a complex interplay of genetic, biological, and phenotypic factors. Studies consistently reveal shared genetic influences between these disorders, with traits such as inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity in ADHD showing moderate to strong genetic correlations with similar traits in ASD. This suggests that these characteristics may stem from common genetic factors. Notably, specific genetic markers like SHANK2 and DRD2 have been linked to both ADHD and ASD. SHANK2, in particular, appears to have a pleiotropic effect, contributing to the risk of both conditions simultaneously. Reaction time variability (RTV) also serves as a bridging factor, as it is associated with ADHD symptoms and social-communication traits in ASD. Future research should focus on expanding genetic studies to identify additional markers and clarify the mechanisms at play, exploring detailed biological pathways, conducting longitudinal studies to track symptom development, and investigating how RTV and other phenotypic traits can improve diagnosis and treatment.",

    "title": "The known and unknown about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) genetics: a special emphasis on Arab population",
    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by behavioral appearances such as impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. The prevalence of ADHD is high in childhood when compared to adults. ADHD has been significantly advanced by genetic research over the past 25 years. However, it is logically conceivable that both genetic and/or non-genetic factors, such as postnatal environmental and social influences, are associated with ADHD phenotype in Arab populations. While genetic influences are strongly linked with the etiology of ADHD, it remains obscure how consanguinity which is an underlying factor for many genetic diseases, contributes to ADHD subtypes. Arabian Gulf Nations have one the highest rates of consanguineous marriages, and consanguinity plays an important contributing factor in many genetic diseases that exist in higher percentages in Arabian Gulf Nations. Therefore, the current review aims to shed light on the genetic variants associated with ADHD subtypes in Arabian Gulf nations and Saudi Arabia in particular. It also focuses on the symptoms and the diagnosis of ADHD before turning to the neuropsychological pathways and subgroups of ADHD. The impact of a consanguinity-based understanding of the ADHD subtype will help to understand the genetic variability of the Arabian Gulf population in comparison with the other parts of the world and will provide novel information to develop new avenues for future research in ADHD.",

    "title": "The Structure of the Relationship Between Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Emotion Dysregulation Among Students in Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Despite previous research indicating a link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and emotion dysregulation (EDR), the precise nature of this relationship remains incompletely understood. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a structural model that elucidates the connection between EDR disorder and the hyperactivity disorder that co-occurs with attention deficit in this population. The study was conducted with a sample of 180 children, assessed by 30 teachers in public schools located in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. To accomplish the study’s aim, the researchers developed a diagnostic scale to identify individuals with the hyperactivity disorder that accompanies attention deficit, as well as a scale to assess EDR disorder. The findings of the study demonstrate a positive association between ADHD and EDR. Despite the limitations inherent in diagnostic research within this domain, the structural model proposed in this study offers a distinctive framework for jointly classifying EDR disorder and ADHD. Future investigations in this often overlooked area may be guided by the divergent predictions offered by each of these models.",

    "title": "Towards an Ontology to Represent Domain Knowledge of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): A Conceptual Model",
    "abstract": "Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) represents a highly heterogeneous and complex medical domain with numerous multidisciplinary research areas. Despite the rising number of research on the pathophysiology of ADHD, the available information in the ADHD domain is still scattered and disconnected. This research study mainly aims to develop a conceptual model of ADHD by applying knowledge engineering processes to structure the domain knowledge, elucidating key concepts and their interrelationships. The methodology for developing the conceptual model is derived from established practices in ontology construction. It adopts a hybrid approach, integrating principles from prominent methodologies such as Ontology Development 101, the Uschold and King methodology, and METHONTOLOGY. The proposed ADHD conceptual model links various aspects of ADHD including subtypes, symptoms, behaviors, diagnostic criteria, treatment, risk factors, comorbidities, and patient profile. Comprising eight top-level classes and highlighting 13 key relationships, it establishes connections between symptoms and recommended treatments, as well as symptoms and their diverse manifestations, risk factors, ADHD subtypes, and potential comorbidities. While the model captures a broad range of ADHD-related concepts, it has certain limitations. It does not extensively address genetic or neurobiological mechanisms, nor does it capture cultural and contextual variations in ADHD manifestations. These limitations highlight opportunities for future expansion, such as incorporating real-world data and diverse demographic contexts. Nevertheless, the model developed in this study is well-suited to serve as a cornerstone for constructing a comprehensive ADHD domain knowledge ontology. Ontologies play a crucial role as a layer for transferring knowledge and serve as a foundation for developing advanced systems, such as decision-support tools and expert systems, to enhance ADHD research and clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is a disorder affecting children worldwide, has lasting effects on their behavior and cognitive functions. This review will explore the complexities of ADHD in children, including its classification, manifestations and management strategies. We will discuss the subtypes of ADHD and how they present challenges in various aspects of a child's life. From difficulties with attention to hyperactivity and impulsivity these subtypes have profiles that impact academic performance, social interactions and emotional regulation. The symptoms of ADHD intertwine inattentiveness, hyperactivity, impulsivity, emotional instability and academic struggles in patients. These symptoms significantly affect a child's functioning across areas such as schoolwork, social life and emotions. To effectively manage ADHD in children requires an approach that combines medication options with interventions, educational support systems tailored to individual needs and parental support programs that emphasize collaboration between healthcare professionals and families. This comprehensive approach seeks to address the requirements of children dealing with ADHD. Its goal is not to reduce symptoms but to improve their long-term outcomes and overall quality of life. By explaining the nature of ADHD in children, this analysis aims to provide an understanding of the disorder. It highlights the significance of customized interventions, early detection, and continuous support in order to enhance the well-being and developmental path of affected children.",

    "title": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder awareness among the Saudi population: A cross sectional study",
    "abstract": "Background and Aims: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major public health problem because of it is associated morbidity and disability in children. It is a multi-faceted dilemma posing social, academic, psychological and psychiatric issues during childhood. This study aimed to investigate the level of awareness about ADHD among adults in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling was conducted in Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia between September 2020 and April 2021 and the sample size was 1148. Sociodemographic characteristics, true and false beliefs, and awareness of ADHD were assessed by online survey. Results: Majority of the respondents agreed that ADHD needs medical treatment by a specialist at early age combined with behavior therapy(85%). 89% of the respondents believed that people with ADHD demonstrate excessive physical movements. 48% of the participants had poor knowledge about ADHD(less than 60% score), the level of knowledge varied with education level. Participants who less educated had lower level of awareness of ADHD. Also, participants who were employed, with high income showed higher level of awareness. The preferred way to increase ADHD awareness was social media(35%) followed by mass media (22%). Conclusions: The awareness of ADHD in adult Saudi population is reasonable but not ideal. Education and employment appear to significantly improve people’s knowledge about the disorder. Social media is the main agent in spreading ADHD awareness among people. Community based proactive and accessible resources must be developed on ‘population based needs and means’ in order to improve ADHD beliefs and awareness levels among the Saudi population.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder in children and adolescents, with estimated prevalence rates varying by the environment, gender, and age of presentation. ADHD research in Saudi Arabia is currently receiving a better research attention. This review aimed to summarize the literature data about ADHD in Saudi Arabia by identifying the prevalence, risk factors, comorbidities, and current guidelines for management. In addition, the author tried to set the gap areas and point out the future needs of ADHD research in Saudi Arabia. About 30 articles were conducted in Saudi Arabia and were reviewed through the PubMed, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate databases. The keywords used were ADHD prevalence, ADHD risk, ADHD comorbidities, ADHD screening, ADHD diagnosis, ADHD management, and ADHD awareness. All the keywords were followed by “Saudi Arabia” to restrict the search to this country. The conclusion of this review is an estimated prevalence rate varying by region, ranging between 2.7% and 16.4% in Saudi Arabia, with a little available data involving the disease outcomes, therapeutic educational intervention, utilization of services, and adherence to the treatment. In addition, the screening and diagnostic instruments used in Saudi Arabia are crucial research areas and must be evaluated and validated. Therefore, further research is required to broaden the horizons of understanding ADHD in the Saudi context.",

    "title": "Attention-Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Symptoms in Saudi Children: Parental Knowledge and Awareness",
    "abstract": "Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common mental health condition in children, affecting social interaction and self-esteem. ADHD is characterized by symptoms such as inattention, hyperactive-impulsive behavior, or both. There is limited research on parental knowledge and awareness of ADHD in Saudi Arabia. Understanding parental knowledge is crucial for effective parenting and treatment compliance. We are aiming to assess parental knowledge and awareness regarding ADHD symptoms. This cross-sectional study utilizes a structured questionnaire developed by the authors. The study includes Saudi parents who have at least one child diagnosed with ADHD and are actively involved in raising their children. Parents of children with intellectual disabilities and those residing outside Saudi Arabia are excluded. The study included 327 participants, the majority of respondents fall within the 21-30 and 31-40 age, comprising 37.0% and 29.1% of the sample. Females constitute a significant majority at 80.7% compared to males at 19.3%. The majority of the population, comprising 52.9%, belongs to the \"Moderate knowledge level\" category, followed by 30.9% to the \"Good knowledge level\" category, and 16.2% low knowledge level. Age, gender, and occupation were the only parameters to have a significant association with knowledge scores, 0.002, 0.012, and 0.005 respectively. In conclusion, ADHD is a prevalent disorder among children in Saudi Arabia, and parents need to be aware of the symptoms and seek proper diagnosis and treatment. Our study findings showed that participants exhibited sufficient knowledge scores compared to other studies held in Saudi Arabia.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Lujan-Fryns syndrome (LFS), a rare genetic anomaly first described in 1984, is characterized by a unique constellation of clinical features primarily attributed to mutations in the MED12 gene. These features include intellectual disability, behavioral complexities, and distinct somatic attributes. Although formal psychiatric criteria are lacking, numerous case studies have revealed a co-occurrence of LFS with psychological manifestations, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This case report explores the intricate relationship between LFS and ADHD, shedding light on potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Background: ADHD is a chronic genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Which is represented by either inattention or hyperactivity symptoms or both. Subsequently, the peak of symptoms appears during childhood and decreases with growing older. Plenty of researches showed various factors could contribute to increasing symptoms' severity. ADHD is considered as one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, Saudi society's awareness of it appears to be relatively lacking. Apart from that, researches showed that teachers and parents misconception about the disorder affects children's improvement as a result of decreased support and not providing a healthy environment for children's case.\n\nObjectives: The general objective is to measure awareness levels of ADHD among college students who majored in special education. Besides, other specific objectives such as assessing their knowledge about dealing with an ADHD child, assessing their thoughts about having an ADHD course and its importance in their career, and evaluating ADHD involvement within special education curriculums.\n\nMethods: Data were collected through a demographic questionnaire along with the Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorders Scale (KADDS). Then, processed by the SPSS Statistics program.\n\nResults: The 88 participants recorded low levels of awareness (39.74%). Especially in the aspects of general features and treatment of the disorder. With a significant difference in the knowledge level regarding those who took university courses about ADHD 86.4% and those who did not. 87.5% of special education students in our sample showed interest in adding a separate course about ADHD. Finally, 89.8% of special education students found their knowledge about ADHD critical in their future careers.",

The goal of this study was to measure burnout and anxiety among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders compared to parents of children with typical development in Saudi Arabia. Results Four hundred twenty-five parents of healthy and parents of children with NDDs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID), and their parents. Parents of children with NDD had more anxiety and burnout relative to parents of typically developing children, and parents of children with ADHD experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression than parents of children with ASD or ID. Conclusion Parents of children with various neurodevelopmental disorders face a greater degree of psychological distress than parents of typically developing children. Parents of children with NDDs should be provided with interventions and resources to reduce stress and enhance their standard of living.",

    "title": "Estimated Prevalence Study of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder among Eastern Province Children in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Background: Studying mental disorders in children is significantly important due to the huge suffering of educational and psychosocial impairments in adult life. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is considered the most common mental disorder in children, especially in early school-aged children. It manifests in about 8%–12% of children in the world. In Saudi Arabia, it affects 4%–12% of children. Objective: The study aimed to count the number of undiagnosed ADHD cases and the associated risk factors in Eastern Province in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among girls’ and boys’ children aged 6–10 years old in Eastern Province in KSA with a random selection of parents. Sample size is equal to 1658. The assessment was done by an online questionnaire filled it by parents using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnostic criteria and Connor’s scale of ADHD excluding any developmental or mental disorder at the beginning of the questionnaire. Results: After excluding the participants who were diagnosed with behavioral and growth developmental disorder, the remaining 1430 have been screened for ADHD based on Connor’s scale. 185 of a child out of 1430 were suggested to have ADHD, of which 10 out of them show the signs of ADHD, 76 of them have moderately severe ADHD, and 99 out of them have atypical or severe ADHD based on Connor’s scale of ADHD. The study shows that there is a significant relationship between the positive screening of ADHD and gender males (71.35%), females (28.64%), family history (20.5%), nervous system diseases (4.32%), brain damage from trauma (9.72%), smoking habit of the mother (8.64%), smoking during pregnancy (3.78%), mother exposure to second-hand smoking (42.16%), child exposure to a toxic substance like lead during the early life (1.62%), and the preterm labor (15.13%). However, the study shows there is no significant relationship between the positive screening of ADHD with age, drinking alcohol, and central nervous system infection. Conclusion: The prevalence of undiagnosed ADHD is slightly high. Also, it has many causes of ADHD including gender, smoking, parental psychiatric disorders, and obstetric and pregnancy problems.",

    "title": "Factors Affecting Knowledge of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Among Female Primary Schoolteachers in Taif City, Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Background Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a public health challenge because it may contribute to academic and psychological difficulties among school children. Though ADHD is a common problem, Taif teachers' knowledge of the disease has never been assessed. Therefore, this study aimed to determine factors that influence ADHD knowledge among female primary schoolteachers in Taif City, Saudi Arabia. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on 359 female schoolteachers recruited by stratified random sampling. Participants self-reported demographic and personal data and completed the validated Arabic version of the knowledge of ADHD scale and teacher's attitude toward ADHD questionnaires. Results In Taif, it was determined that 96.4% of female primary schoolteachers had insufficient knowledge of ADHD, notably with nature, causes, consequences, and treatment knowledge. In contrast, 40% had adequate knowledge of the condition's symptoms and diagnosis, and 97.5% exhibited a favorable attitude. There is significantly higher knowledge among private schoolteachers, those who freshly graduated, specialize in learning difficulties, who attended any course/training about ADHD, and whoever taught ADHD children. There was a significant positive weak correlation between teachers' knowledge of ADHD and their attitude. Regression analysis revealed that female schoolteachers specialized in learning difficulties show significantly higher knowledge scores, teachers who never taught an ADHD child had a reduction of 94.6 % in ADHD knowledge, and any increase in the number of ADHD children teachers teaches has significantly increased teachers' knowledge (Overall Model: Chi-Square X2= 69.514, p < 0.000**). Conclusions Our study showed that there was a serious knowledge gap on ADHD among Taif female primary schoolteachers. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to boost teachers' knowledge of ADHD, especially at government schools, through conducting training courses, distributing leaflets intended to address ADHD, and launching awareness campaigns through the media, including social media, television, and radio. It is also recommended that education faculty curricula should include more information on ADHD.",

    "title": "Knowledge of and attitude toward attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) assessed among primary schoolteachers of Makkah City in Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "A BSTRACT Background: One of the most prevalent pediatric medical conditions is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is characterized by symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention. The first people to notice a child’s ADHD symptoms are typically their teachers, who may then offer data that are typically helpful in its diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to assess teachers’ knowledge of ADHD, its causes and etiology, as well as the key demographic factors that influence said knowledge. Method: The study was conducted among schoolteachers of primary schools located in different regions of Makkah City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We used a stratified random sampling technique to collect our sample, with the inclusion criteria being teachers who were working in a primary school and who were directly involved in teaching students. Data analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics software version 21. Results: We received 335 responses to our questionnaire. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 59 years, with the mean age being 40.2 ± 13.8 years. About 66.9% of teachers were women. Most of the teachers in this sample had a bachelor’s degree (73.4%), and only 21.8% had diplomas. Regarding the years of teaching experience, 34.6% had teaching experience exceeding 20 years, whereas 20.6% had less than five years of teaching experience. Regarding general knowledge of the teachers, (5.4%) of the teachers had a good level of knowledge. Only 63.6% of teachers were aware that ADHD students frequently struggled with task and activity organization, and only 7.5% of teachers had good knowledge of ADHD treatment, compared to 40.9% who had a good awareness of symptoms and diagnosis. Only the teachers’ education level was significantly associated with their knowledge level of ADHD: 25% of teachers with a postgraduate degree had an overall good level of knowledge versus 2.7% of those with a diploma ( P = 0.006) Conclusion: The findings of this study lead to the conclusion that elementary school instructors have an inadequate understanding of ADHD. Some teachers misunderstand the signs and general facts associated with ADHD, thereby indicating the need for further training in this area.",

    "title": "Prevalence and Risk Factors of Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder in the Saudi Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Objectives: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Saudi Arabia. Methods: Observational studies (case–control, cohort, and cross-sectional) that reported the prevalence and risk factors of ADHD among Saudis and were published in English were included. In March 2022, a computerized search was conducted on Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science, and Scopus using keywords associated with ADHD and Saudi Arabia. Two-stage screening and data extraction were performed. The National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional studies was used for the quality assessment. A random-effects model was used to estimate the prevalence. The Comprehensive Meta-analysis program was used for the analysis. Results: Fourteen studies (N = 455,334 patients) were included. The pooled prevalence of ADHD in the Saudi population was 12.4% (95% CI: 5.4%–26%). For ADHD-Inattentive and ADHD-Hyperactive presentations, the prevalence was 2.9% (95% CI: 0.3%–23.3%) and 2.5% (95% CI: 0.2%–20.5%), respectively. Regarding the combined AD and HD, the prevalence was 2.5% (95% CI: 0.2%–20.5%). Children of women with psychological disorders during pregnancy (P = 0.043), insufficient vitamin B during pregnancy (P = 0.006), allergic reactions (P = 0.032), and disabling symptoms of muscle pain during pregnancy (P = 0.045) were associated with an increased risk of ADHD. Conclusions: The prevalence of ADHD in the Saudi population is comparable with that in other countries from the Middle East and North Africa region. Careful monitoring of pregnant women, attention to nutritional sufficiency, psychological and emotional support, and avoidance of stressful events may lead to reducing the incidence of ADHD in the offspring.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in children and is described as a disease involving loss of self-control. The core symptoms of ADHD are inattentiveness, impulsivity, and motor unrest. Furthermore, poor concentration, distraction, hyperactivity, and poor academic achievement at school or at home are other symptoms. ADHD, like other prevalent medical disorders such as asthma and schizophrenia, may be impacted by several genes and has multiple contributing causes that are not all related to each other. The management of ADHD contains multimodal treatments, starting with psycho-education for parents and the child or adolescent patient in an age-appropriate manner called cognitive behavioral therapy. The worldwide prevalence rate of ADHD among children is 7.2% and, in some countries, can be higher and reach 15.5%; studies show the average prevalence of ADHD in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is 9.2%.",

We found no significant difference in the prevalence of ADHD between males and females (odds ratio (OR)=1.48; 95% CI=0.53-4.14; p value=0.456). The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis did not change the statistical significance proving that a single study did not drive the pooled effect size. Regarding parents’ educational level, the prevalence was the highest among children born to fathers with at least a secondary education 51% (95% CI= 22.97-100.00), while the prevalence rate was comparable among those with primary school education 16.6% (95% CI=1.28-100.00) and illiterate fathers 17% (95% CI=12.84-22.59). The difference between different education subgroups was statistically significant (p=0.040). There were no statistically significant differences in ADHD prevalence when comparing different mothers’ educational levels (p=0.260). The estimated cumulative evidence is high but comparable with the reported worldwide rates. Unlike these studies, the prevalence of ADHD was not associated with gender or maternal education. On the other hand, the highest prevalence of ADHD was found among children of fathers with at least a secondary education.",

    "title": "Relationship between attention deficit hyperactive disorders with life satisfaction among medical students in city of Hail, KSA",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) begins in childhood, and its symptoms persist into adulthood. Students with ADHD symptoms will be at increased risk of antisocial behavior, depression, and loss of inhibition. This study determines the relationship between ADHD and life satisfaction level among medical students in the city of Hail, KSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted in a public-sector medical college. A total of 200 students were recruited through stratified cluster sampling. Validated, structured scales of ADHD and life satisfaction were used, and known psychiatric disorders among students were excluded from the study. Correlation and linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between ADHD and life satisfaction and identify the determinants of ADHD. P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULT: The prevalence rate of ADHD among medical students was 33.3%. Female gender, third-year academic year student, and 21–26-year-old age group were the high-risk groups of ADHD. Inattention ( r = -0.263, P value -0.000) and hyperactivity ( r = -0.260, P value 0.000) were significantly correlated with life satisfaction level, with 92% of the variability in life satisfaction determined by inattention and hyperactivity. CONCLUSION: The burden of ADHD is high among medical students, and it negatively correlates with life satisfaction level. Students' academic and social functioning was affected due to ADHD. There is a need to address this issue with early diagnosis and management of this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) need teaching strategies that support their learning, such as Dunn and Dunn’s model, which can help them reach their full potential. This study aimed to investigate teachers' knowledge of Dunn and Dunn's model as one of the learning styles models and their perceptions of the importance of using it for students with ADHD. This study utilized a descriptive approach by employing a survey to collect the data. The study sample consisted of 115 teachers in elementary schools in Riyadh city that have ADHD programs. The findings of the study indicated that teachers had no knowledge of Dunn and Dunn’s model, and therefore their perceptions about the importance of using it were low. Additionally, the results showed that there were no significant differences based on the variables (gender, educational qualification, specialization, training courses). The results did, however, reveal that there were significant differences according to the years of teachers’ experience: two to five years of experience showed optimum results. Based on the results of the study, several recommendations were suggested, such as the importance of lectures and workshops under the supervision of specialists in the appropriate learning style.",

    "title": "The Prevalence of Risk Factors Among Children Diagnosed With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Aged 4–17 Years: A Cross-Sectional Study",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly observed in children. Although the etiology of ADHD is still unclear, many risk factors have been shown to increase the prevalence of ADHD, such as genetics, environmental factors, socioeconomic status, maternal smoking, and low birth weight. Aim: The current cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of several risk factors associated with ADHD-diagnosed children aged 4-17 years using parent-reported data. Methods: An observational cross-section study was conducted between December 2022 and February 2023 using a self-constructed questionnaire that we sent to parents whose children were diagnosed with ADHD. The questionnaire included socioeconomic information (income, gender, parent education, number of children), child information (age, ADHD type, academic achievement), pregnancy and neonatal period (smoking status, gestation age, mode of delivery, child weight), and if there is a history of ADHD in the family. Results: A total of 306 parents responded to the questionnaire. The majority of our study population was males (77.8%). The combined type, which includes symptoms of both hyperactivity and inattention, represented 70% of the population in our study, which is higher than the inattention type (23%) and the hyperactivity type (6%). The prevalence of several risk factors known to be associated with ADHD, such as family income, parental education, complications during pregnancy, and the low birth weight of the child, were also reported. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the frequency of risk factors among children diagnosed with ADHD in Saudi Arabia. The study revealed that males are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females. We also found that the combined type is the most diagnosed ADHD among children. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in the prevalence of the risk factors during the gestational or neonatal period among ADHD-diagnosed children. Therefore, a large-scale prospective study is needed to aid in evaluating the frequency and significance of various risk factors among diagnosed children",

    "title": "The Prevalence of Video Game Addiction and Its Relation to Anxiety, Depression, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Children and Adolescents in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study",
    "abstract": "Background and objective Video games have become a popular source of entertainment among children and adolescents, not only targeting the young generation but also increasingly popular among older demographics as well. This study aimed to assess the association between video game addiction and depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children and adolescents in Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study involving Saudi adolescents aged 12-16 years. A self-administered online survey was distributed on social media (Twitter, WhatsApp, and Snapchat). The survey addressed sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, area of residence city, etc.). Arabic versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (PHQ-GAD7), the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS), and the seven-item Game Addiction Scale (GAS-7) questionnaires were distributed as well, including Arabic terms for depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Results A total of 393 surveys were completed (males: 58.3% vs. females: 41.7%). Of note, 63.1% of the respondents reported playing video games every day with an average of more than five hours of gaming time per day (25.2%). The prevalence of video game addiction was 62.1%. Independent risk factors of video game addiction included being young in age, playing video games every day, playing more than three hours per day, and playing multiplayer games. Furthermore, our findings suggest that a higher video game addiction score is correlated with higher scores in inattention, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion This study found a high prevalence of video game addiction among Saudi children and adolescents. Excessive video game playing negatively influences mental health and leads to issues including anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Also, younger males with an increased rate of regular playtime were more likely to exhibit video game addiction in comparison to the rest of the population. Further research is required to more comprehensively assess the prevalence rate of video game addiction and its effect on the mental health of the younger generation within the region.",

    "abstract": "Auditory processing disorder (APD) is defined as difficulty in listening despite possessing hearing thresholds within the normal limit. Understanding rapid speech, following complex instructions, and listening in the existence of background noise are some of the difficulties in APD. APD has been observed in diverse clinical populations with suspected or diagnosed disorders, such as attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, aphasia, and Alzheimer’s disease; however, it should be differentiated from these disorders. Despite the research on APD, its awareness is limited, resulting in it often being undiagnosed. Therefore, improving the awareness and understanding of APD is important. The current paper aims to review the literature on APD with a focus on school-age children. The prevalence, etiology, screening, and diagnosis of APD are discussed along with correlated disorders, interpretation of tests, and management strategies.",

    "title": "An Exploratory Investigation of Difficulties in Applying Functional Behavior Assessment and Implementing Behavioral Intervention Plans in ADHD Programs in Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Functional behavior assessment (FBA) and behavioral intervention plans (BIPs) can be effective for students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, teachers may face difficulties when implementing FBA procedures and, in turn, BIPs because of lack of time, insufficient training, and multiplicity of beliefs. Thus, it is important to identify the difficulties teachers may face and the obstacles that can deter them from implementing intervention plans. This is a worthwhile endeavor because nearly all classrooms will have students with behavioral problems who will benefit from specifically designed educational interventions. This study aimed to identify the difficulties in applying FBA and the barriers in implementing BIPs among Saudi teachers in specialized ADHD programs. Using the descriptive-analytical approach, a questionnaire targeting difficulties and barriers was admi- nistered to 209 public school teachers from specialized ADHD programs in Saudi Arabia. The results revealed that the difficulty level of applying FBA in ADHD programs was high. The level of barriers in implementing BIPs was moderate. Finally, the study indicated that barriers in implementing BIPs could be predicted by the difficulties of applying FBA. The results suggest the importance of finding better practices, restructuring the provision of ADHD programs, training teachers, improving assessment tool availability, and ensuring cooperation between school administrators and teachers.",

    "title": "Assessment of School Health in Saudi Arabia: The Path to Improved Future Students Health. (Implications of the Saudi School Health Program)",
    "abstract": "Background: The health and wellbeing of school students are of essential value to world communities. In Saudi Arabia (SA), a school health program was initiated with the strategic goal of enhancing the health of the students and the early detection of any health problems.\nAims: This study aimed to identify the most common health problems and conditions among school students in SA based on the periodic examination program for school students (PEPSS).\nMethod: A retrospective secondary data analysis from the Ministry of Health (MOH) was based on the program collected in 2018 across four school grades, namely, 1st primary, 4th primary, 1st intermediate, and 1st secondary grade, from 40 school complexes around SA. The collected data included variables related to sociodemographic, family history, past infec- tious diseases, completion of vaccinations, body mass index (BMI), visual acuity tests, dental examination, scoliosis tests, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). Data were entered and analyzed using an SPSS program (version 20) where descriptive statistics were calculated, the association between an outcome and some main variables were also calcu- lated, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant at a confidence interval of 95%.\nResults: From the overall 12,032 students, 46.6% were males, and 53.4% were females. The most common health problems reported were tooth decay (62%), low visual acuity (15.3%), overweight (9.7%), and obesity (8.8%). Although almost all students were fully immunized (99.4%), the health status was calculated as less likely lower among males than females (AOR 1.26; 95% CI: 1.17-1.37).\nConclusion: The results concluded that dental caries and visual acuity were the highest health problems among students. The widespread prevalence of dental caries indicates the need for more research to appraise the public health implications of this developing problem.",

The study will also examine Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and sadness by gender. 200 mixed-gender primary school students from many schools were the study sample. They were 9–13. The descriptive (comparative) study used the Pearson correlation coefficient and t test. The study used Al-Naubi (2005)'s Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder exam and the Scale of Children's Depression. developed by Abdul Khalique, Ahmed (1991). The questionnaire was the primary data collection technique. The study found a positive correlation and statistical significance between the total sample of primary school students (both sexes)' Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder test scores and their Scale of Children's Depression test scores. The study found statistically significant differences between the average scores of the study sample members from primary school kids in the variable Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder according to gender, favoring males. The average depression scores of primary school students were likewise statistically significant, favoring females. The study suggests using new and diverse educational approaches for ADHD children to create an appealing learning environment and activate family therapy for them and their families to find the optimal educational methods.",

These data systems are powerful tools that can inform decision-making and policy creation, as well as advancing and disseminating knowledge. Here, we review three types of data systems (patient registries, clinical trial registries and genetic databases) that are concerned with ASD or ADHD and discuss their features, advantages and limitations. We noticed the lack of ethnic diversity in the data, as the majority of their content is curated from European and (to a lesser extent) Asian populations. Acutely aware of this knowledge gap, we introduce here the framework of the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Database (NDDB). This registry was designed to serve as a model for the national repository for collecting data from Saudi Arabia on neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly ASD and ADHD, across diverse domains.",

    "abstract": "Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most frequent psychiatric disorder in children, and it has a detrimental impact on the child's social, familial, and familial functioning. Teachers are frequently the first to suspect attention ADHD in their students since they are with them for the most of the day and are familiar with how normal students behave in the classroom.\nAims & Objective: this study aims to identify and measure the awareness and attitude of primary teachers towards the diagnosis and management of students with ADHD.\nSubjects and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a primary school in the AlBaha area of Saudi Arabia from January 18 to April 24, 2022. Data were collected using a written questionnaire in Arabic language and simple vocabulary. Data was statistically analyzed using SPSS (version 25).\nResults: Around 361 participants completed the questionnaire; worked in AlBaha. Therefore, they were included in the analysis. Most of the teachers were female (N = 226, 62.6%) and had bachelor's as their highest qualification (N = 296, 81.9 %). For most of the questions, the teachers had inadequate or poor knowledge, around 66.5% of teachers had more than ten years of work experience.\nConclusions: The study emphasized the lack of understanding of ADHD among primary and kindergarten school teachers in AlBaha city. This information gap raises severe concerns about the screening of ADHD at the school level in Saudia Arabia.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Intellectual disability (ID) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental issue globally. People having ID suffer invariably from psychiatric, behavioral, and emotional disturbances. It is reported that a high rate of comorbidity predisposes the patients to a poorer prognosis and quality of life especially if undiagnosed and untreated. We specifically aimed to study the comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders in this vulnerable population group and to find any association with various related variables.\n\nMaterial: The observational cross-sectional study was conducted on male and female patients admitted with disabilities in Rehabilitation Centre Majmaah. The data was entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS 26.0.\n\nResults: The number of participants (n) was 147. The mean age of the patients was 24.32+2.19 years. Out of all patients, 17 (11.6%) had mild, 33 (22.4%) had moderate, 56 (38.1 %) had severe and 41 (27.9%) had profound ID. About 72% of the sample (n=42) had comorbidity with either a medical or a psychiatric illness whereas 12 participants (8.17%) suffered from both physical and psychiatric disorders. In this study, n= 30/147 (20.40%) had psychiatric comorbidity. There was a preponderance of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and Behavioural Disorders. Around 87 patients out of 147 (59.2%) had one or more physical comorbidities. The most common medical comorbidities were Epilepsy (26.53%). Overall, significant association was found between severity of and psychiatric diseases (p=0.023).\n\nConclusion: Physical and psychiatric comorbidities are common in ID patients. ADHD, Behavioural Disorders and Epilepsy were predominant in the research.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to investigate attitudes and beliefs among parents of patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with regard to symptoms, causes, prognosis, and management. The study was of a cross-sectional descriptive design including 283 parents of patients with ADHD (preschool, primary school, and adolescent). It was conducted at child and adolescent outpatient clinics in Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh to assess parents’ knowledge, attitudes, treatments, and beliefs regarding ADHD. Among 283 parents, 59.8% believed that diet could improve ADHD symptoms. Approximately 75% of parents believed that ADHD is a form of misbehavior rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder, whereas 55.6% believed that ADHD is a genetic disease. In total, 89% of parents wanted to treat their children by receiving specialist advice and recommendations. A significant and nonsignificant correlation between gender and preschool and primary school was recorded, respectively. However, a positive correlation was recorded between age and caregiver’s education in adolescents. Since parents’ attitudes and perceptions were poor overall, the mismanagement of ADHD was noticed. Furthermore, government-level media campaigns should be implemented to enhance parents’ knowledge and debunk myths in order to improve ADHD management.",

    "title": "Pragmatic Disorder in Children with ADHD",
    "abstract": "Although language disorders are not among the fundamental features or required to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, several research studies revealed a high prevalence of communication disorders among children with ADHD. The evidence from the literature suggests that inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity have their effects on different speech and language skills. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association claimed that co-occurring ADHD and speech and language disorders represent a frequently encountered challenge for school-based speech-language pathologists and other practitioners. Also, it is not uncommon to find that children with speech and language disorders are also being treated for ADHD. Language disorders are common in ADHD with accumulating evidence from several research studies on pragmatic language difficulties. Although research has examined many important aspects of language and ADHD, there have been relatively few studies that have looked at the critical aspects of the child with ADHD ability to communicate effectively. This review is an effort towards provide a description for the pragmatic disorders in children with ADHD.",

To identify the teachers' knowledge and attitude regarding ADHD is vital for this progression of psycho-academic and exercising methods for teachers. The present cross-sectional study was conducted among male school teachers to know the knowledge and awareness of ADHD. Methods: A Structured questionnaire was distributed among 120 school teachers. The questionnaire component consists of 7 multiple-choice questions regarding the symptoms of ADHD, 5 queries regarding the etiology of the issue, 5 questions regarding the therapy, and 6 queries concerning the outcomes of ADHD. Data was collected and statistical analysis done. Results: Their mean age was 38.38 ± 5.77 years, ranging from 25 to 58 years, with a mean level of teaching experience of 12.63 ± 4.11 years. The teachers' understanding was more specific regarding the symptoms of ADHD (73%), accompanied by their consequence's knowledge of ADHD (64.9%). A mean of 61.1% and 56.8% of teachers offered appropriate answers concerning the etiology and therapy for the problem, respectively. Conclusion: Concluded that teachers got satisfactory knowledge of ADHD and suggested they should improve even more knowledge on its causes, symptoms, and treatment to boost the educational functionality of students.",

    "title": "Study regarding the level of awareness and understanding about ADHD among teachers when dealing with ADHD students",
    "abstract": "Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common disorders, which describes students with learning and behavioral difficulties. It is a severe developmental disorder with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity symptoms. Sometimes, teachers intend to refer ADHD students to mental health professionals to prevent these problems. The objective of this research is: 1) To investigate Saudi elementary and kindergarten teachers' understanding and knowledge of ADHD. 2)To demonstrate how the impact of teaching strategies increases awareness of ADHD and helps students with ADHD to improve their academic performance. 3)To recommend to the Ministry of Education in Jeddah to set up a general training program for learning disabilities for all teachers in Saudi Arabia. The study focused on K-6 female teachers; four schools were selected in this study. A mixed-methods design was used to evaluate teachers 'knowledge and understanding of ADHD. The researcher gathered data from the questionnaire and interviews. For the questionnaire, (N=15) teachers were selected for kindergarten and (N=15) for Elementary. (N=8) teachers were interviewed to discuss their beliefs and strategies for dealing with students with ADHD. The interview questions were about how teachers understand the situation of ADHD students. The qualitative and quantitative data were collected separately. The fifteen kindergarten teachers who participated in the questionnaire had an average number of 11.33 of knowledge about ADHD. The 15 Elementary teachers had an average number of 9.53%. In general, the findings showed that both Kindergarten and teachers had some knowledge about the general characteristics of ADHD, but they had little understanding of causes and interventions.\nIn conclusion, Saudi teachers indicated that they had truly little training about ADHD, especially in the classroom, which affects their acknowledgment of this disorder. This study did not assess attitudes and behavior toward children with ADHD. Therefore, it is important that future researchers must assess teachers' attitudes and behavior toward those children.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders among children. Working memory deficits underlie many of the behavioural symptoms of ADHD. Alongside psychostimulant medications, strategies to improve working memory may play an important adjuvant role in the management of ADHD. In this study, we review the role of working memory deficits in ADHD, the evidence surrounding working memory training strategies in the management of the condition, and the factors affecting the success of these strategies in alleviating ADHD symptoms. More specifically, we review several non-pharmacological interventions that target working memory deficits in ADHD, with special emphasis on cognitive working memory training. We conclude that the development of evidence-based interventions such as computerised cognitive training (CCT) could provide an alternative or adjunct to the use of psychostimulants, especially in cases where side effects are a major issue.",

    "abstract": "he magnitude of CAMH has emerged from this region.\r\r\nAims: \r\r\nThis study aimed to report the prevalence rates of CAMH disorders in the GCC through a systematic review of the existing literature followed by a meta-analysis.\r\r\nMethods: \r\r\nA systematic review of the literature from the six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) was conducted. The databases used included Scopus, ProQuest, Pubmed, and a final check was performed on Google Scholar to account for any remaining studies that may have still been under review. Meta analytic techniques were then used to estimate prevalence rates of each specific mental disorder, i.e. ADHD, depression, anxiety, stress, eating disorders, and tobacco use disorder.\r\r\nResults: \r\r\nA total of 33 studies from the six countries were included. The pooled prevalence of ADHD as per the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (VADHDDRS), clinical judgments, Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scale (ADDES), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was found to be 13.125%, 13.38%, 26.135%, and 12.83%, respectively. The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms solicited by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid) was 44.684%, 45.09%, and 26.12%, respectively. The pooled prevalence of anxiety according to the DASS and the MINI Kid was 57.04% and 17.27%, respectively, while the pooled prevalence of stress as per the DASS was found to be 43.15%. The pooled prevalence of disordered eating solicited by the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) was 31.55%. Lastly, the pooled prevalence of tobacco use disorder per the Global Youth Tobacco Survey was 19.39%.\r\r\nDiscussion: \r\r\nTo date, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of its kind from the GCC. The prevalence rate of CAMH disorders appears to be in the upper range of international trends. The higher rates could be attributed to the existing studies using suboptimal methodological approaches and instruments to solicit the presence of CAMH....",

    "title": "Prevalence of Health Problems Targeted by the National School‐Based Screening Program among Primary School Students in Saudi Arabia, 2019",
    "abstract": "The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) established a National School‐Based Screening Pro‐ gram (NSBSP) for health screening of schoolchildren. Students from specific grades were systematically screened for several health problems, including obesity, visual and auditory problems, dental cavities, scoliosis, and attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This cross‐sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of these health problems among primary school students based on secondary data obtained from the NSBSP. We included 444,259 screened school children from the first and fourth grades of 50% of the selected schools (both private and public) across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) during the academic year 2018–2019. Among them, the most prevalent health problems identified were dental cavities (38.7%), eye refractory errors (10.9%), and overweight and obesity (10.5%); the less prevalent problems included ADHD (2.81%), auditory problems (0.6%), and scoliosis (0.48%). A greater prevalence of most health problems was observed in girls more than boys. The NSBSP successfully aided the detection of health conditions with high and low prevalence among primary school students in the KSA, and thus, the identification of health problems of specific concern. Implementation of effective school health services for the prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of these health problems are imperative.",

Teachers identified ADHD by completing the Vanderbilt ADHD scale. Compared to controls without ADHD, students with ADHD were more likely to have early parental loss, head trauma, motor/language delay, family psychiatric problems, and high family stress. Among those with ADHD, risk factors for psychiatric comorbidity were older age, family psychiatric history, and motor/language delay. Risk factors for impaired academic/behavioral performance were high family stress, family psychiatric problems, and chronic illness. Identifying risk factors for ADHD and common comorbidities associated with this disorder may help parents, teachers and clinicians detect this condition, increasing effective management.",

    "abstract": "The present paper aims at determining the contribution of the Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) and self-esteem to predicting Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) among female university students in Saudi Arabia. It examines the differences in the research variables according to academic achievement. It also identifies the correlations of these variables. The authors applied the research instruments, i.e., the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1), Adult Concentration Inventory (ACI), and Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) to a sample of 203 female university students aged 19-31 years (M = 23.29 years; SD= 3.74 years). The results showed no differences in the mean scores of ASRS, ACI, and negative self-esteem in the achievement levels among university students. In contrast, there was a positive direct relationship between ADHD, SCT, and negative self-esteem. SCT contributed significantly (by 40%), whereas self-esteem contributed by 6% in predicting ADHD among university students. The study highlighted the contribution of both negative self-esteem and SCT to predicting ADHD among Saudi university students to understand the nature of the disorder and its predictors. The findings of this study can be utilized to develop preventive programs for enhancing self-esteem and increasing attention among university students.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a training programme in increasing teachers’ knowledge of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. The sample comprised 124 teachers from schools in the said region, and these teachers were divided into two groups: (1) experimental group with 62 teachers and (2) control group with 62 teachers. The quasi-experimental approach was employed for collecting data; the Cognitive Awareness Scale of ADHD (Melhem, 2020) was also employed. It consists of 37 items distributed into three domains, namely, general knowledge, characteristics and diagnosis and treatment. Results revealed that the effectiveness of the training programme in increasing teachers’ ADHD knowledge was in favour of the experimental group. Moreover, no statistically significant differences were observed in the increase of the levels of ADHD knowledge amongst the teachers in the experimental group due to the variable of teaching experience. That is, the levels of ADHD knowledge of teachers from the experimental group are the same according to their teaching experience. In sum, the training programme significantly increased the levels of ADHD knowledge of teachers from the experimental group. Moreover, educational institutions in Saudi Arabia should include ADHD training programmes in teacher-training curricula in Saudi Arabia.",

    "title": "Elementary School Counselors' Level of Knowledge of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: The Case of the North Border Region of Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "School counselors play a critical role in the identification and management of students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In order for the counselors to effectively help students with this condition, it is important that they have knowledge about this disorder. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the level of knowledge that elementary school counselors in the Northern Border of Saudi Arabia have with (ADHD). The Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (KADDS) was used to evaluate the counselors. The KADDS scale has three sub-scales that test general knowledge, diagnosis and symptoms, and treatment of ADHD. The study sampled 89 of approximate 200 school counselors working at elementary schools across the Region. The study data was analyzed using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences. The counselors got 31% of the questions in the general knowledge sub-scale correct while 43% were answered incorrectly, and 26% answered, “don’t know.” In the diagnosis/symptoms sub-scale 63% of the questions were answered correctly, 21% were answered incorrectly, while 16% answered “don’t know.” In the treatment sub-scale 38% of questions were answered correctly, 26% were answered incorrectly while 36% answered “don’t know.” Overall, 41% of the questions were answered correctly, 32% were answered incorrectly, while 27% answered “don’t know.” Based on these findings, the researcher concluded that the school counselors in the Northern Border Region of Saudi Arabia do not have sufficient knowledge of ADHD. This lack of knowledge invariably inhibits their ability to help children with ADHD.",

The study findings indicated that teachers of students with (ADHD) knowledge of effective educational interventions varied. It also found that female teachers’ knowledge of interventions is greater than the knowledge of male teachers. The exception was the cooperative learning intervention, in which the results were in favour of male teachers more than females. Moreover, the results showed that the knowledge of special education teachers of educational interventions was greater than that of general education teachers, and that the knowledge of teachers with less experience was greater. In addition, the knowledge of teachers who received training courses in the field of (ADHD) was greater than those who did not receive training courses in the field.\n\nSource Link [Arabic]",

    "abstract": "The present study aims to uncover the knowledge of kindergarten teachers about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children and the influence of educational level, years of experience, and specialization on their level of knowledge. The study's sample consists of (128) female teachers. To achieve the objectives of the study, the researchers uses the Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (KADDS) (Sciutto, Terjesen & Frank, 2000) and the descriptive survey method for data collection. Findings of this empirical study reflect that the level of knowledge of kindergarten teachers of ADHD is somewhat low. Interestingly, results also display no statistically significant differences in the level of knowledge of kindergarten teachers of ADHD in terms of the total degree of knowledge of the disorder according to the educational level variable. Moreover, participants of this study show no statistically differences in their specialization regarding the general information about the nature and causes of the disorder and the diagnosis process according to the variable of specialization. In addition, no statistically significant differences found in the level of knowledge of kindergarten teachers according to the variable of years of experience. Therefore, the study recommends providing pre and in-service training programs related to raising the level of awareness and cognitive competence of ADHD disorder of kindergarten teachers.\n\n \n\nمعرفة معلمات مرحلة رياض الأطفال باضطراب فرط الحركة وتشتت الانتباه عند الأطفال وعلاقته ببعض المتغيرات\n\nهدفت الدراسة الحالية إلى الكشف عن مستوى معرفة معلمات مرحلة رياض الأطفال باضطراب فرط الحركة وتشتت الانتباه عند الأطفال، وأثر المستوى التعليمي وسنوات الخبرة والتخصص على مستوى المعرفة لديهن، تكونت عينة الدراسة من (128) معلمة، ولتحقيق أهداف الدراسة استخدم الباحثان مقياس المعرفة باضطراب فرط الحركة وتشتت الانتباه The Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (KADDS) Sciutto, Terjesen & Frank,2000)) والمنهج الوصفي المسحي لجمع البيانات، وأظهرت نتائج الدراسة أن مستوى معرفة معلمات مرحلة رياض الأطفال باضطراب فرط الحركة وتشتت الانتباه عند الأطفال منخفض إلى حد ما، كما أظهرت النتائج عدم وجود فروق دالة إحصائياً في مستوى معرفة معلمات مرحلة رياض الأطفال باضطراب فرط الحركة وتشتت الانتباه فيما يتعلق بالدرجة الكلية للمعرفة بالاضطراب وفقاً لمتغير المستوى التعليمي، كما توصلت النتائج إلى عدم وجود فروق دالة إحصائياً في مستوى معرفة معلمات مرحلة رياض الأطفال باضطراب فرط الحركة وتشتت الانتباه وفقاً لمتغير التخصص، فيما يتعلق بالأبعاد التالية: معلومات عامة عن طبيعة وأسباب الاضطراب؛ وعلاج الاضطراب، بينما وجدت فروق ذات دلالة إحصائية في مستوى معرفة معلمات مرحلة رياض الأطفال بأعراض الاضطراب وعملية التشخيص تبعاً لمتغير التخصص، كما أشارت النتائج إلى عدم وجود فروق ذات دلالة إحصائية في مستوى المعرفة لدى معلمات مرحلة رياض الأطفال وفقاً لمتغير سنوات الخبرة.\n\nSource Link: JEPS.QU.edu.sa",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives To estimate lifetime prevalence of mental disorders in the Saudi National Mental Health Survey (SNMHS). Methods The SNMHS is a face‐to‐face community epidemiological survey in a nationally representative household sample of citizens ages 15–65 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) (n = 4,004). The World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to estimate lifetime prevalence of common DSM‐IV mental disorders. Results Estimated lifetime prevalence of any DSM‐IV/CIDI disorder is 34.2% and lifetime morbid risk is 38.0%. Anxiety disorders are by far the most prevalent (23.2%) followed by disruptive behavior (11.2%), mood (9.3%), eating (6.1%), and substance use (4.0%) disorders. Synthetic estimates of cohort effects suggest that prevalence of many disorders has increased in recent cohorts. Onsets typically occur in childhood for a number of anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders and in adolescence or early adulthood for most other disorders, although age‐of‐onset distributions for drug abuse is much later (median age of 31) than in CIDI surveys carried out in other high‐income countries. Conclusions Lifetime mental disorders are highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia and typically have early ages‐of‐onset.",

    "title": "Saudi Clinicians’ and Teachers’ Discourses About Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed neurobehavioral disorder among children. Using Foucauldian discourse analysis, this study uncovers the discourses drawn upon by six Saudi teachers and four clinicians as they describe their experiences and understanding of ADHD. Saudi clinicians approach ADHD as an extension of American medical views in terms of its causes, diagnosis and treatment. Alarmingly, in light of the shortage of recommended ADHD medications, there are accounts of antipsychotic medications being prescribed for children. Saudi teachers views of ADHD were an extension of the medical discourse; this meant that students strengths were ignored and the focus was entirely on negative behavioral patterns. Despite the tendency to attribute ADHD to genetics, teachers objectified students who acted out' as having ADHD or even other disorders (when the child's behavior or symptoms diverged from their limited understanding of ADHD). Parents who do not comply with teachers' suggestions are blamed for any lack of improvement in the child's behavior and academic attainment. These findings have implications for individuals and institutions providing ADHD education to both doctors and teachers, and reinforce calls for researchers to examine ADHD outside of the genetic 'box'.",

    "title": "The Co-existence of ADHD With Autism in Saudi Children: An Analysis Using Next-Generation DNA Sequencing",
    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. Several studies have confirmed the co-existence of other neuropsychiatric disorders with ADHD. Out of 106 individuals suspected to have ADHD, eight Saudi Arabian pediatric patients were diagnosed with ADHD using a dual assessment procedure based on highly significant scores from the international criteria for diagnosis; (full form DMS) DSM-5. Then, these patients were examined for the co-existence of autism and ADHD using different international diagnostic protocols. Four patients with combined ADHD and autism and four ADHD patients without autism were examined for the presence of genetic variants. Six variants (chr1:98165091, chr6:32029183, chr6:32035603, chr6:32064098, chr8:2909992, chr16:84213434) were identified in 75% of the patients with ADHD and autism, indicating that these genes may have a possible role in causing autism. Five variants (The chr2:116525960, chr15:68624396, chr15:91452595, chr15:92647645, and chr16:82673047) may increase to the severity of ADHD. This study recommends screening these eleven variants in ADHD cases and their relevant controls to confirm the prevalence in the Saudi population. It is recommended that future studies examine the 11 variants in detail.",

The study also explored the effect of variables namely teacher's knowledge, years of experience and teachers' gender on reported ADHD symptoms among primary grade students. A questionnaire survey methodology was adopted for the study. 550 children were included in the teachers' survey. Teachers assessed the ADHD symptoms in children using an 18-item scale based on DSM-V. The results indicated that the prevalence rates of ADHD among school-age differed according to ADHD subtypes. The Inattention type was rated by 35.34%, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity type was rated by 28.60%, and ADHD-C type was rated by 21.3% of the respondents. According to gender, for the Inattention subtype, the ratio between boys and girls was 1.7:1, for the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subtype, the ratio between boys and girls was 2.03:1, and for combined subtype, the ratio between boys and girls was 2.2:1. According to the grade level, the highest prevalence of ADHD overall was found in grade three and the lowest prevalence was in grade six in all ADHD types. The present findings indicated that teachers' knowledge and gender (female) successfully predicted teacher-rated ADHD status.",

The aim of this study was to extend previous efforts to estimate the prevalence of emotional and behavioral disorders among children in Saudi Arabia in order to evaluate the need for intervention services. In the current study, teachers of students aged 4-17 years in Saudi Arabia were surveyed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire – Teacher version. The findings of the study suggest that students with emotional and behavioral disorders in Saudi Arabia may account for almost 25% of the population of school students between the ages of 4 and 17. The findings also revealed that teachers complained the most about behaviors that are related to conduct followed by problems with peer relationship.",

    "title": "Consistency of child self-reports with parent proxy reports on the quality of life of children with attention_deficit/ hyperactivity disorder in Riyadh, 2016",
    "abstract": "Background: The quality of life (QoL) of children with attention_deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has not been addressed in Saudi Arabia despite the considerable attention it has on account of its prevalence, duration of illness, and sociopsychological effects. The aim of this study was to report on the QoL of children with ADHD and test the concord between children&quot;s and parents&quot; reports. Materials and Methods: Using the generic PedsQLTM (version 4.0) from both children&quot;s and parents&quot; perspectives, a cross_sectional study of 112 children was conducted on children aged 5-18 years with an established diagnosis of ADHD attending child psychiatry clinics of three referral hospitals in Riyadh between December 2015 and May 2016. Results: A total of 112 children with an established diagnosis of ADHD were recruited from the Child Psychiatry Clinic of Al Amal Mental Health Complex (41.1%), Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC), (33%), and King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), (25.9%). The majority were boys (74.1%) and Saudi nationals (93.8%). The mean age of children with ADHD was 10.45 &plusmn; 3.06 years (Range 5 _ 18 years). One_fourth of the mothers of children with ADHD had completed high school and 41.1% had a diploma, university, or postgraduate degree. One_third of the fathers of these children had completed high school (34%) and 38.4% had a diploma, university, or postgraduate degree. The intra_class correlation coefficients between the scores of children and parents were good for physical functioning, fair for social functioning, but moderate for school, emotional, and psychosocial functioning. Children rated themselves significantly better than their parents for emotional, social, school, and psychosocial functioning. The standardized response means indicated a small difference for social functioning and medium differences for the other three domains. The only significant discrepancy was observed in social functioning in relation to the child&quot;s age. Conclusion: Parents mirrored adequately the observable physical component of the QoL of their children. The QoL report of children with ADHD with respect to communications and intellectual abilities should be taken into account whenever possible and their parents&quot; report also should be sought to provide a more comprehensive view of the child&quot;s status.",

    "title": "Knowledge and Attitude of Female Teachers Toward ADHD at Elementary Schools, Jeddah, KSA, 2017",
    "abstract": "Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatry disorders in children, it has negative impact on the academic, familial and social functioning of the child. The recent advances in its treatment calls for social intervention including school-based activities, which necessitates knowledgeable teachers. Aim: The main aim of this study is to explore the level of knowledge and attitude of the school teachers of female primary schools  in Jeddah  about ADHD.  Subjects and  methods: Through a  cross sectional design, 376  school teachers were selected by multistage  sampling from female primary schools in Jeddah, they were  invited to fill a predesigned valid questionnaire reflecting their knowledge and attitude towards ADHD. SPSS ver 21 was used for data entry and statistical analysis which included descriptive as  well as  analytic analysis using Chi square test. P value<0.05 was considered an indication for significance. Results:  Almost one half of the teachers (47.6%) aged between 40-49 years, who were mostly married (81.1%) and having children (84.3%). Out of them, 8.2% reported that they have ADHD child. Although that more than one half of the teachers (54.3%) thought that they had knowledge about  ADHD,  the true  knowledge test  questions revealed  a much  lower percentage  (24.5%) who  showed  good knowledge about ADHD. Only older teachers had significant better knowledge. More than one half of the teachers (57.2%) perceive that the first step in the management policy when suspecting ADHD is the referral of the child to advisor and asking for attendance of the parents. Conclusion and  recommendations: Most of the teachers have insufficient level of knowledge about ADHD. There is a tangible need for training programs provided to the teachers about early recognition and policy of care of ADHD children.",

    "title": "Prevalence of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among medical students in Riyadh City",
    "abstract": "Background: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by the inability to sustain attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Recent studies showed that it can persist in adulthood. The modification of the &rsquo;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in its fifth edition has a significant impact on detecting adult ADHD. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies done on adult ADHD among medical students in the Gulf region. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 487 medical students from all academic year from February 1, 2018, until March 31, 2018, in two governmental and one private medical school in Riyadh city. Self-reported English questionnaire paper used for the study was composed of two parts; socio-demographic and adult ADHD screening scale of DSM-5 version. Results: Fifty-three students (10.9%) reported symptoms of ADHD. Concerning the prevalence and percentage, there was no noticeable difference in gender (p value = 0.364), academic year (p value = 0.666), nationality (p value = 0.379), colleges (p value=0.836), and age (p value = 0.992). History of early life ADHD was significantly associated with adult ADHD (p value = 0.012), along with students grade point average, mainly from a score of three and above out of five (p value = 0.024). Conclusion: Our study found a higher prevalence of ADHD among medical students compared with worldwide prevalence. This difference could be due to social and cultural factors. Those individuals may have difficulty in communication and learning which can disturb academic efficiency, lengthen their study, and even disturb their development.",

    "title": "Prevalence of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Children Attending Paediatric Endocrine Clinic at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurobehavioral disorder with a substantial lifelong impact on the health system in general. It is one of the most frequent childhood-onset psychiatric conditions, with an estimated worldwide-pooled prevalence exceeding 5% in school-age children, and a prevalence of 1.3-16% in Arab countries. We hypothesized that pediatric endocrine clinics are one of the potential places of ADHD. Thus present study aims to investigate the prevalence of ADHD in children attending pediatric endocrine clinic, determine which gender group is affected more, and address the possible associated factors of ADHD. Method: A quantitative, observational cross-sectional approach was used to estimate the prevalence of ADHD. The study population was children attending pediatric endocrine clinic at KKUH in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, approached during their regular visit in the clinic from November2015 to March2016, and interviewed to fill a questionnaire includes social demographic questions, medical profile, and a valid screening tool for ADHD. Results: Analysis revealed that the prevalence of ADHD in the study sample was 14.9% (46 cases out of 309 children). 67.39% of these cases were males (31 male case out of 309 children). Results provided evidence that ADHD was associated with low social economic status (SES), and other social demographic characteristics. There was no evidence to suggest any association between ADHD and obesity, thyroid dysfunction, and growth deficit. Conclusion: ADHD occurs in males more than females. It has a high prevalence in children with different endocrine pathologies although there was no relation between (growth deficit, thyroid dysfunctions, and Obesity) and ADHD, except diabetes where diabetic child was found to be less likely to develop ADHD. Anyhow, further studies with bigger sample size will help understanding this link.",

    "title": "Attention Deficit Disorders among Adult Learners: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment",
    "abstract": "In the present scenario of curriculum change, modification and possible reform, the traditional approach of teaching has been cynically criticized. Due to different reasons, many institutions have started reducing teaching time from 40-50 minutes to 15-20 min in length. Lack of attention among learners may be one of the most significant factors. A review of the literature on this topic reveals many facts drawn from previous studies. The most alarming findings could be related to significant decrease in students\" attention during a lecture/class. Such behavioural patterns are very dangerous for learners, and wastage for parents as they may lose a human resource. Therefore, the present theoretical approach towards Attention Deficit Disorders (ADHD) among Saudi learners in general and adult learners in particular will explore something useful which can be treated as a base for further researches especially empirical studies.",

    "abstract": "Education in Saudi Arabia, including the education of children with special needs, is developing rapidly. However, children with emotional and behavioral disorders are neither consistently identified nor adequately served in Saudi Arabia although they are recognized as a distinct category of children who require special education services. The goal of this study was to examine the prevalence of emotional and behavioral disorders among children in Saudi Arabia to assess the need for intervention services to help those children reach their potential. The current research identified the types of behaviors that are most evident in the study sample. Also, the relationship between demographics and emotional and behavioral disorders is studied to identify possible predictors of disruptive forms of behavior. Parents of children aged 4-17 years in Saudi Arabia were surveyed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The findings of the study suggest that children with emotional and behavioral disorders in Saudi Arabia may account for 20% of the population of children between the ages of 4 and 17. The findings also revealed that over 20% of children in Saudi Arabia have difficulties in peer relationship and lack the necessary prosocial behaviors. The parent reporting, child gender, child education type, the geographical region, the fathers education level, and the familys socioeconomic status were found to be statistically significant predictors of children difficulties. However, these predictors were only able to explain a small portion of the difficulty scores.",

    "abstract": "Background: Non-antipsychotic medications are frequently used in psychiatric patients with a variety of disorders. However, there is limited research concerning weight gain and metabolic changes in mentally ill population. Objective: This review aimed to critically describe non-antipsychotic psychotropic (NAP) medications and their impact on weight in the psychiatric population. Also, the biological and psychosocial mechanisms of weight gain or loss attributed to NAP and antipsychotic medications are also described in this paper. Methods: Electronic searches (2000-2018) of PubMed, Medline,and Google Scholar were conducted using Boolean operators and keywords. Large numbers of articles were retrieved, and two independent reviewers retained 85 articles published in English peer-reviewed journals. Results: Only a few non-antipsychotic psychotropic medications prescribed to psychiatric population produce overweight and some metabolic changes, but most of them cause minimal weight gain, or they are weight-neutral and weight-loss. Variable results are reported concerning biological mechanisms attributed to genetics, individual vulnerability, diagnosis and pharmacology of antipsychotic and non-antipsychotic psychotropic medications. Conclusion: Unlike antipsychotic medications, non-antipsychotic psychotropic drugs cause the least weight gain mediated by multiple mechanisms, but mostly without meeting salient features of metabolic syndrome. Further studies are needed to explore metabolic changes and underlying mechanisms concerning psychotropic drugs given chiefly to mentally ill patients around the world.",

    "title": "Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation on Some of the Physiological Changes in Boys with Moderate ADHD Symptoms",
    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may persist into adolescence and adulthood. It is suggested that insufficient nutritional supply of LC-PUFAs (long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) and minerals (including serum levels of zinc, iron, magnesium, calcium and copper) may develop ADHD symptoms. However, clear and convincing evidence is lacking. Subjects in the present report were boys with moderate ADHD symptoms who were categorized into control group (C; mean age: 8.34 years), ADHD group (mean age: 8.72 years), and ADHD-O group (or ADHD- supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids (mean age: 8.69 years). Significant reduction in serum zinc, iron, magnesium and calcium in ADHD group without omega-3 supplementation compared to healthy control subjects, and significant increase in these nutrient bioelements after omega-3 supplementation in ADHD reaching to the levels found in healthy non-ADHD control subjects were the findings in our present study. Although the definite cause/ causes of ADHD are not yet known, omega-3 and other long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) seem promising in understanding the pathophysiology and exploring additional management of ADHD.",

    "title": "Evaluation of plasma neurotransmitters in children living with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to ascertain the underlying neuro-biochemical imbalances that exist in children with ADHD by assessing the plasma levels of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, _ amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Moreover, it investigated the potential effects of PUFA and vitamins supplementation as an alternative therapy to modulate the levels of these neurotransmitters and the overall clinical status of ADHD patients. The study included 40 ADHD patients, aged 4-6 years. The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) test has been employed to diagnose patients with ADHD and the severity of symptoms was assessed using the Arabic version of Conners' Parent Rating Scale. Additionally, patients were assessed using the Arabic versions of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children (M.I.N.I. Kid) and Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, 5th Edition (SB5). Recruited patient received nutritional supplement of semi-solid diet containing 1000 mg PUFA with selected vitamins once daily for six months. The evaluation of ADHD symptoms and levels of neurotransmitters has been carried out at pre-/post-intervention stage. Post-nutrition intervention assessment, there was a significant increase in dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA levels (p-value < 0.0001) with significant decrease in glutamate level (p-value < 0.0001) when compared to their correspondent pre-intervention levels. Symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity were significantly improved after 6 months nutrition intervention program (p-value<0.001). Therefore, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins could be considered more extensively in therapy of ADHD patients particularly those who are less than 6 years old",

But it is rarely studied outside of the Western world, raising questions as to whether it can be generalized beyond this. In this study the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS-11) was administered on two university student samples; one Egyptian (N = 450) and one Saudi (N = 396), in order to close this gap and to observe differences between sexes and cultures. We compared the Saudi samples with samples from typical Western countries (Germany, USA) by using Hofstede&quot;s cultural dimensions as a means of assessing cultural differences. We found no indicators of sex differences or cultural differences along the superficial division between countries from the Western and Arab-Muslim world. Also, more differentiated cultural dimensions were predominantly unrelated to BIS-11 factor scores. Implications for further research and limitations, such as the inclusion of more samples from Arab-Muslim countries and the use of samples more representative for the whole population, were discussed.",

    "abstract": "Objective: We assessed the level and source of knowledge and attitude of male primary school teachers about attention_deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: A cross_sectional study was conducted from January to November 2016 involving Saudi male teachers currently working at 17 primary schools in Khashm_Alaan district, Saudi Arabia. A prevalidated, self_administered, structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Teachers mean knowledge score was measured in the following three categories: insufficient, good, and very good. Results: Only 141 out of 182 teachers completed the questionnaire. Mean age of participants was 36.16 ± 6.6 years with teaching experience of 12 ± 6.2 years. Bachelors degree was the highest qualification reported by 86% of participants. Seventy_two percent of the teachers had either very good (13%) or good (59%) knowledge about ADHD. Almost half of them reported multiple sources such as internet, social media, and television for obtaining information about ADHD. However, internet and social media alone were reported as a source of information by 13% and 11.4%, respectively. Those who attended any course on ADHD had significantly (P = 0.006) more knowledge about the disorder. Furthermore, those teachers having taught a child with ADHD had more knowledge about the disorder. A significant correlation between mean knowledge and attitude scores was observed. Conclusion: Two_third of the teachers had knowledge about ADHD. Those who had either attended a course or taught a child with the ADHD had significantly more knowledge about the disorder. Most of the teachers learned about the disorder from multiple sources.",

    "title": "Psychotropic Medications Weight Gain: A Clinical Dilemma Looked Through the Lens of Therapeutic Challenges, Complementary Approaches and Pharmacotherapies",
    "abstract": "Background: Psychotropic drugs especially second generation of antipsychotics and antidepressants are used in psychiatric patients with severe mental disorders. These disorders are associated with weight gain and obesity that poses clinical challenges. This needs individualised- tailored integrative interventions including the promotion of health and wellbeing. Objective: The review critically assimilates evidence-based data on several aspects of psychotropic-induced weight gain with a focus on therapeutic challenges and multidimensional integrative management strategies along with pharmacological interventions. Methods: Electronic searches of three databases (from 2000 to 2018) using Boolean operators and keywords retrieved thousands of peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals. Based on exclusion and inclusion criteria 141 pertinent articles were retained for this review. Results: Overweight in psychiatric patients on weight increasing psychotropic medications is associated with a variety of adverse consequences and therapeutic challenges. Overweight and obesity is reported to need a multimodal patient-centred approaches regarding lifestyle changes, dietary modifications and medicinal herbs, cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational psychotherapy and weight controlling pharmacological interventions. Multimodal treatment directed towards overweight is often delivered by a multidisciplinary team in well-equipped clinical settings. Symptom relief from the primary psychiatric illness is necessary for this strategy to work. Conclusion: Although overweight or obesity secondary to psychotropic medication poses a number of treatment challenges, an integrative intervention that combines complementary therapies with conventional medications appears to work best. This review calls for comparative research to determine the most effective strategies to combat weight gain in psychiatric populations.",

Two-thirds of children with ADHD have an additional coexisting disorder [4] and more than one-third have at least three comorbid conditions [5]. Estimates of the overlap between speech and language disorders and ADHD vary from as low as 8% to as high as 90%, depending on the source and type of sample [2].

However, when analysing further, it is clear that this interest is only visible in medical areas, and is not given consideration in educational areas. This research discussed the educational status of children with ADHD, since several studies have confirmed that many of the children with this diagnosis face learning difficulties in reading and/or writing, maths, and more. The results emphasise that teachers adopt varying approaches to teaching, and these may be positive or negative. Moreover, advice was shared amongst teachers of such children, with the statement made that knowledge into ADHD is needed, further stating that a number of challenges are faced when seeking to deliver the most suitable learning environment. The study suggested that teachers should be afforded ADHD-relevant training, with advice on how to work with ADHD children&quot;s parents/carers.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease (LCPD) is a juvenile hip disorder in which interruption to the blood supply of the femoral head causes osteonecrosis. Previous studies reported an association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and LCPD. This study aimed to assess the relationship between ADHD and LCPD disease in a tertiary hospital in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is a case-control study that included 50 case subjects (LCPD group) and 100 controls. Both groups underwent clinical assessment by the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria to diagnose ADHD and to compare the proportions in both groups. Results: The age range of the study population was 4-19 years. In the case group, we collected the data from 11 females and 39 males. The age ranged from 4 to 19 years (mean 9 years). While in the control group, we collected the data from 47 females and 53 males. The age range was 4-15 years (mean 8 years). In both groups, 34 children (22.7%) were diagnosed with ADHD, 15 (30%) in the case group and 19 (19%) in the control group. There was no significant difference in ADHD incidence between the case group and the control group (P = 0.1293, odds ratio = 1.827). LCPD has a significant male predominance (78%). Conclusions: We found that the prevalence of ADHD in LCPD is high (30%), which is comparable to the reported literature but as ADHD was higher than the reported literature in the control group (19%) the difference was statistically insignificant.",

These schools offer a bachelor degree in speech hearing rehabilitation, which started only a few years ago. For this reason, the number of Saudis certified as speech and language therapists is very limited, which has led to several issues regarding diagnosis, therapy and speech services in the kingdom being raised. First hand reports from trained speech and language practitioners suggest that it is common for children with a range of communication difficulties to receive a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, with other internationally recognized diagnostic labels (e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; ADHD) being far less commonly used.",

    "title": "A pilot study investigating the association between sleep and cognitive function among adolescents",
    "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the relationship between sleep and cognitive function among adolescent subjects in Riyadh. Methods: The sample consisted of 98 (44% female) subjects aged 10-16 years. Each participant filled in a well-structured pre-coded questionnaire regarding demographic data, including a sleep questionnaire; cognitive function was assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Battery (CANTAB). The cognitive function outcome variables were response times in the attention-switching task (AST) and the percentage of correct answers in the pattern recognition memory (PRM) task. Results: There were significant differences in measures of AST-latency (p = 0.005), AST-congruent (p = 0.012), and AST-incongruent (p = 0.009), while no significant difference was found in the PRM task score (p = 0.336) within gender groups. There was a significant correlation between sleep and AST switching cost (0.277, p = 0.006) and sleep and AST latency (0.188, p = 0.063) across the group. Conclusion: This study showed that gender differences in cognitive function were significant in the group of adolescents. Additionally, this study shows that insufficient sleep can impair attention and accuracy in adolescents.",

    "title": "ADHD Awareness Among Medical Students",
    "abstract": "Background: Early recognition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is needed to prevent its psychosocial and educational consequences. We aimed to study ADHD awareness among medical students and identify correlating and contributing factors to their lack of knowledge. Methods: A cross sectional study included 5th year medical students attending their pediatric rotation from September 15, 2012 until June 15, 2013 at King Abdulaziz University hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A structured 25-item questionnaire was designed to examine their demographics , educational experience, and awareness questions about ADHD. Results: Of 120 approached students, 111 were included with ages ranging from 20-29 years (mean 22) and 69% being females. Most students 69 (62%) were enrolled during their pediatric rotation and 97 (87%) already completed their psychiatry course. Although most students (67%) recognized ADHD, only 13 (12%) categorized their level of knowledge as very good or excellent. Only 24% correctly recognized ADHD subtypes and 58% did not know what is the initial required management step. Only 19 students (17%) correctly recognized all ADHD features based on the DSM IV criteria with a mean correct score of 69% (standard deviation 14). No correlations were found with their age, gender, completing their pediatric/ psychiatry rotation, or specialty interests. Conclusions: Medical student\"s level of knowledge about ADHD needs improvement. This has to be corrected in order to improve early recognition and intervention. Increased ADHD education and exposure during pediatric/neuroscience modules are needed in our region.",

    "abstract": "Internet-based social networks such as Twitter are rapidly gaining popularity among Saudis, and an increasing number of them are using the internet to source information about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).The Saudi ADHD Society (known in English as the AFTA Society) is the only charity serving people with ADHD in Saudi Arabia.This article examines the representations of ADHD by AFTA Society members on Twitter, because they have come to define how ADHD is talked about in Saudi Arabia.The AFTA Society Twitter account (@adhdarabia) has over 13,500 followers.Tweets posted between December 1 st , 2016 and January 31 st , 2017 were collected, with those announcing AFTA events and retweets from other accounts eliminated.This resulted in 141 tweets discussing the nature, causation, and treatment of ADHD.These tweets were analyzed using Foucauldian discourse analysis.Findings reveal that AFTA Society tweets construct ADHD as an experience of suffering, and position children with ADHD as sufferers, often subject to additional problems.An alternative discursive construction of ADHD is that caring for a child with ADHD is a 'different' kind of responsibility for parents and teachers, who must be advised by 'experts'.The implications of these discourses are discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Emotional and Behavioral Problems (EBPs) have an adverse impact on a child's education performance. EBPs have been considerably addressed in the Europe and North America nonetheless in Middle East, North Africa and most parts of Asia including Saudi Arabia, they have not been adequately addressed. This study sought to establish the prevalence rates of EBPs, examine the EBP differences between non-clinical students and students with learning disabilities; determine the gender and age differences in terms of EBPs and lastly to establish interactional effects of age and gender on EBPs. The current study adopted a descriptive survey with a sample of 1121 participants; 798 non-clinical students and 323 students referred for learning disabilities. The teacher informant version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used as a research instrument. Students with learning disabilities and younger students (age<12) had higher EBP rates (with p-values below 0.05). Females had higher EBP rates for emotional symptoms and pro-social behavior, and males for conduct problems. Finally, there were gender-age interactional effects on: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity and total difficulty score (p-values<0.05). Generally, there were differences between students with learning disabilities and those referred to as non-clinical; male and female; as well as younger and older, in terms of EBP rates. There were gender-age interactional effects on EBPs. The study suggested that educators should develop mechanisms like guidance and counselling to ensure that differences in EBPs are adequately addressed.",

    "abstract": "This is the third in a series of four cross-cultural empirical studies designed to develop International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, and Children and Youth version, ICF(-CY) Core Sets for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). To explore the perspectives of individuals diagnosed with ADHD, self-advocates, immediate family members and professional caregivers on relevant areas of impairment and functional abilities typical for ADHD across the lifespan as operationalized by the ICF(-CY). A qualitative study using focus group discussions or semi-structured interviews of 76 participants, divided into 16 stakeholder groups. Participants from five countries (Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Sweden) were included. A deductive qualitative content analysis was conducted to extract meaningful functioning and disability concepts from verbatim material. Extracted concepts were then linked to ICF(-CY) categories by independent researchers using a standardized linking procedure. In total, 82 ICF(-CY) categories were identified, of which 32 were related to activities and participation, 25 to environmental factors, 23 to body functions and 2 to body structures. Participants also provided opinions on experienced positive sides to ADHD. A high level of energy and drive, creativity, hyper-focus, agreeableness, empathy, and willingness to assist others were the most consistently reported strengths associated with ADHD. Stakeholder perspectives highlighted the need to appraise ADHD in a broader context, extending beyond diagnostic criteria into many areas of ability and disability as well as environmental facilitators and barriers. This qualitative study, along with three other studies (comprehensive scoping review, expert survey and clinical study), will provide the scientific basis to define ICF(-CY) Core Sets for ADHD, from which assessment tools can be derived for use in clinical and research setting, as well as in health care administration.",

    "title": "Analysis of shared homozygosity regions in Saudi siblings with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder",
    "abstract": "Aim: Genetic and clinical complexities are common features of most psychiatric illnesses that pose a major obstacle in risk-gene identification. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent child-onset psychiatric illness, with high heritability. Over the past decade, numerous genetic studies utilizing various approaches, such as genome-wide association, candidate-gene association, and linkage analysis, have identified a multitude of candidate loci/genes. However, such studies have yielded diverse findings that are rarely reproduced, indicating that other genetic determinants have not been discovered yet. In this study, we carried out sib-pair analysis on seven multiplex families with ADHD from Saudi Arabia. We aimed to identify the candidate chromosomal regions and genes linked to the disease. Patients and Methods: A total of 41 individuals from multiplex families were analyzed for shared regions of homozygosity. Genes within these regions were prioritized according to their potential relevance to ADHD. Results: We identified multiple genomic regions spanning different chromosomes to be shared among affected members of each family; these included chromosomes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, and 18. We also found specific regions on chromosomes 8 and 17 to be shared between affected individuals from more than one family. Among the genes present in the regions reported here were involved in neurotransmission (GRM3, SIGMAR1, CHAT, and SLC18A3) and members of the HLA gene family (HLA-A, HLA-DPA1, and MICC). Conclusion: The candidate regions identified in this study highlight the genetic diversity of ADHD. Upon further investigation, these loci may reveal candidate genes that enclose variants associated with ADHD. Although most ADHD studies were conducted in Other populations, our study provides insight from an understudied, ethnically interesting population. Published online ahead of print.",

    "abstract": "Aim: The aim was to measure the level of perception and knowledge of dental care providers to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at King Abdulaziz University faculty of dentistry (KAUFD), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: Three-part questionnaire with an explanatory method were mailed to 50 specialist pediatric faculty members and residents (Master, Doctorate degrees and Saudi Board) and 140 dental interns and externs. The first part of the questionnaire includes the participants\" demographic information. The second part related to the participants previous clinical and educational experiences with ADHD and the third part included questions related to the participants\" knowledge and management of ADHD. The respondents were asked to choose only one choice from 3 choices (agree, disagree, I do not know). Results: Working experience was found to be a significant factor (P ≤ 0.05) in relation to the background knowledge of the participants when comparing those with 10+ years of work experience to those with 1-3 years and 4-9 years work experience. Additionally, female participants had better knowledge than their male counterpart (pConclusion: The background knowledge among a sample of oral health care providers in KAUFD was found to be statistically and positively related to the work experience in terms of years of practice as well as the social and demographic status of the participants.",

    "title": "Effect of applying play therapy on children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder",
    "abstract": "Background: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a serious public health problem affecting a large number of children that often lasts into adulthood, and it is characterized by persistence of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. Children with ADHD are managed with appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention such as educational, psychological, behavioral support and play therapy. Whereas, play therapy is a technique during which the child would be given an opportunity to experience development under the most ideal circumstances. Aim: Evaluate the effect of applying play therapy on children with ADHD. Methods: Study Design: A quasi experimental. Setting: The study was conducted in Badghish care &amp; Rehabilitation center at Jeddah in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Subjects: Purposive sample composed of 40 preschool &amp; school age children with ADHD with their parents and teachers. Study Tools: Data were collected through using a self-administered questionnaire for the parents to assess the socio-demographic characteristics of the studied children and their families, Conner&quot;s Abbreviated Parents and Teachers Rating scale, it was used to assess and evaluate the problematic behaviors of children with ADHD for their responses and progress monitoring through play therapy, Children&rsquo;s Symptom Inventory (CSI-4)-Parents and Teachers Form Scale, it was used to assess the children for ADHD symptoms including; inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity through their parents and teachers and Vanderbilt ADHD Parent and Teacher Rating Scale, it was used to assess children&rsquo;s anxiety symptoms through their parents and teachers. Results: The mean age of children was 6.282 &plusmn; 1.52 years. Also, 67.5% of children were boys and 32.5% were girls. Meanwhile, there were high statistical significant differences ( p -value at .00) regarding children inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity as reported by their parents and teachers pre and post applying play therapy. Conclusions: The current study concluded that applying play therapy had a positive effect on paying attention, decreasing hyperactivity and controlling impulsive behavior of children with ADHD. Also, there were statistical significant differences in children&rsquo;s emotional and behavioral disturbances pre and post applying play therapy sessions. Recommendations: Encourage parents to cooperate actively when play therapy sessions are held for persistency of treatment effects and further studies should be carried out on the effectiveness of play therapy and use of other different kinds of therapies for children with ADHD are beneficial.",

    "title": "Indicators of Conduct Disorders Among Adolescents in Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "This study aims to explore and explain the degree of CDs&quot; indicators among adolescents in school, society, and the home; and also the differences in these indicators based on the boys&quot; age, school class, and parental status. This involves interpreting qualitatively the quantitative outcomes. Mixed methodology was used to answer the research questions. A sample of 1,245 students from five intermediate schools in Taif, Saudi Arabia was selected randomly by using cluster sampling. A structural questionnaire was administered on these students. Then, a semi-structured interview was developed and applied on a non-random sample of 15 students. The outcomes show that CDs&quot; indicators are higher in society compared with the indicators at home and in schools. The results also show that the adolescents&quot; age (from 13 to less than 14, and from 15 to less than 16), in the third year in intermediate school, and whose parents are either separated or are both dead, represent the highest means in CDs&quot; indicators. All the interviewed boys discussed their aversion to school, their community, and home, as well as their beliefs about others&quot; bad opinions of them. The current data provides a strong hint that there are high degrees of CDs&quot; indicators among Saudi teenagers, and there are differences in these indicators in school, society, and at home (and also differences based on the boys&quot; ages, school class, and parental status), which would contribute to more understanding of adolescent psychological disorders in general and specifically in teenagers with CD in Saudi Arabia.",

    "abstract": "Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common multifactorial and complex neuro developmental disorder often persisting through adolescence and adulthood. Indications of nutritional treatments with omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals like zinc, magnesium, iron, etc. are gaining importance. We therefore sought to estimate, and compare the mineral content of zinc, magnesium, and iron in the plasma of ADHD diagnosed children with normal non-ADHD children, and establish a correlation if any with the disorder symptoms. Methods and findings: Psychiatric evaluation was performed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV and plasma elemental analysis using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Low levels of zinc, magnesium and iron were observed in ADHD children when compared to their healthy controls. Conclusion: Children with ADHD exhibit lower concentrations of plasma zinc, magnesium, and iron as compared to normal controls which could be correlated with the disorder symptoms in ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of the study was to 1) determine the prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) among both governmental and private primary Saudi school children, 2) measure the gender difference of ADHD prevalence, and 3) determine any association between the socio-demographic characteristic of the parents of children with ADHD. Methods: This is an observational cross-sectional study of 1000 primary school children belonging to 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade. The selected students were screened by the ADHD rating scale using multistage sampling technique. The first stage was selection of 20 schools from all Riyadh regions by simple randomization. The second stage was choosing children whom serial numbers were multiples of five in each class. The ADHD rating scale was filled by both parents and teachers along with a socio-demographic questionnaire for the parents. Results: The estimated prevalence of ADHD was 3.4%. ADHD manifestations affect boys more than girls. In addition, ADHD was more frequent among children of illiterate mothers. Finally, ADHD was significantly more prevalent among first grade children. Conclusion: This epidemiological study filled the data gap of ADHD prevalence in Riyadh. The study&rsquo;s findings go in line with many nearby and global studies.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to determine the level of training preparedness that teachers in KSA have in handling students with ADHD/ADD and explore the experiences of the teachers in regular schools as related to dealing with students that have the ADHD condition. Moreover, it determines the future proposals that would be useful in increasing the value of the education system in the KSA as far as the ADHD students are concerned. A sample of five female participants through an interview process, it was noted that the interviewees agreed with the findings of the literature review. There is much that needs to be done because there is very little help that is coming out to the students based on the level of the system lacking in the required level of threshold to proving the required pedagogical requirements. A collection of findings are figured out in this analysis of the results obtained from the data as related to the literature. Most of the teachers (80%) were discontented with the training system as related to dealing with students that have special conditions. The Saudi system will therefore need to focus on improving its training pedagogy that would take to account the idea of dealing with such conditions.",

This study focuses on quantity of verbal output through investigating the verbal productivity and length of turns in children with ADHD compared to age-matched typically developing (TD) children. The participants were twenty Saudi 4-5 year old boys. Ten were typically developing and ten had a diagnosis of ADHD. A 30 minute sample of speech during free play was collected from each child in conversation with an unfamiliar adult interlocutor (UI). All sessions were filmed and audio-recorded, the interactions transcribed then number of turns and whole words per turn counted. The results were statistically analyzed and showed that children with ADHD had a reduced verbal output with respect to total number of words, total number of verbal turns and average number of words per turn compared to typically developing children of similar age. It is argued that the differences are evidence of the negative effect of the core behavioral characteristics of ADHD on verbal pragmatic skills.",

    "abstract": "Objective: No systematic reviews could be identified in the literature that address ADHD research in Arab countries. In an attempt to help fill this gap, this systematic review was undertaken. Method: An electronic literature search of ADHD studies carried out in Arab countries was done by using Google Scholar, PsycINFO, PubMed, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Arabpsynet. Results: The search yielded 58 studies (10 studies on psychoeducational and social aspects of ADHD, 26 prevalence studies and two reviews of epidemiology of ADHD, and 22 studies on risk factors and comorbidities in ADHD). Conclusion: Although there has been an increase in ADHD research in Arab countries in recent years, this research remains relatively sparse and used methods and procedures that limit the generalizability of the findings.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neglected illness in both developing and developed countries; it represents a growing public health concern because of its long-term adverse effects, long-term treatment and the significant financial impact on families, schools and community. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of attention deficit hyper activity symptoms among Al dawadmi primary schools children as reported by their teachers and assess prevalence of symptoms according to children social characteristics. 52 students were included in the study from 6 primary schools in Al dawadmi city (3 males & 3 females) were chosen according all students suffer from ADHD symptoms as reported by their teachers and by their parents who accepted to their children participate in the study research. Data were collected during March 2015. Finding and conclusion: Nearly one third of the studied subjects suffer often from attention deficient symptoms aged from 10-<12, it was often manifested by female student (38.5%) more than male (30.7%) also hyperactivity/ impulsivity symptoms were often manifested by first child. More than half of studied subjects always had learning difficulties (55.8%) and avoid tasks which need concentration or mental effort (69%). One third of the studied subject has not guilt feeling. Recommendations: Early detection of the manifestations in affected children at early stage is significantly recommended to develop specific psychological intervention for them. All primary school children should be examined for prevalence of the manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is among the most prevalent disorders of childhood and adolescence worldwide. Teachers are likely to play an important role in multiple stages of the help-seeking process (e.g., problem recognition) for children with ADHD. This study examined the relationship of prior exposure and ADHD training with teachers knowledge and misconceptions of the disorder in a multinational sample. Teachers (N = 2,307) from nine countries (Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Iraq, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, United States, and Vietnam) completed measures of ADHD knowledge, prior exposure, and education/training related to ADHD. There was considerable variability in overall levels of knowledge and specific misconceptions across the countries sampled. Although the predictors of ADHD knowledge varied considerably across countries, some form of professional training and prior exposure to ADHD was associated with greater knowledge in the majority of countries. Implications for teacher training and the role teachers can play in the help-seeking process are discussed. Note: Saudi data published previously in 2013 (PDF: Teachers&rsquo; Knowledge and Misconceptions of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)",

    "title": "GNB5 mutation causes a novel neuropsychiatric disorder featuring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, severely impaired language development and normal cognition",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Neuropsychiatric disorders are common forms of disability in humans. Despite recent progress in deciphering the genetics of these disorders, their phenotypic complexity continues to be a major challenge. Mendelian neuropsychiatric disorders are rare but their study has the potential to unravel novel mechanisms that are relevant to their complex counterparts. RESULTS:In an extended consanguineous family, we identified a novel neuropsychiatric phenotype characterized by severe speech impairment, variable expressivity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and motor delay. We identified the disease locus through linkage analysis on 15q21.2, and exome sequencing revealed a novel missense variant in GNB5. GNB5 encodes an atypical _ subunit of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G_5). G_5 is enriched in the central nervous system where it forms constitutive complexes with members of the regulator of G protein signaling family of proteins to modulate neurotransmitter signaling that affects a number of neurobehavioral outcomes. Here, we show that the S81L mutant form of G_5 has significantly impaired activity in terminating responses that are elicited by dopamine. CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrate that these deficits originate from the impaired expression of the mutant G_5 protein, resulting in the decreased ability to stabilize regulator of G protein signaling complexes. Our data suggest that this novel neuropsychiatric phenotype is the human equivalent of Gnb5 deficiency in mice, which manifest motor deficits and hyperactivity, and highlight a critical role of G_5 in normal behavior as well as language and motor development in humans.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to provide quantitative data on parental experiences with their children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to focus more on their opinion about medication and the role of psychological assessment and interventions. The study sample included 211 parents of children with ADHD. More than half of the parents think that ADHD could be treated without medication and that their child is too young to have psychotropic medication with its side effects. There were concerns about misdiagnosis and being too quick to prescribe medications. Psychometric assessment and psychological intervention were infrequently used and their experience with combined interventions is almost rare. Pressure from schools to prescribe medication was one of the parents concerns. Parental satisfaction with medication occurred when an improvement in school performance was noted. It is essential for health professionals to be aware of parents experiences and to develop a proper evidence-based intervention for ADHD which includes psychological counselling or combined interventions and not to rely on medication intervention alone.",

    "abstract": "Despite the wealth of knowledge on subclass formation for antisocial behavior among youth from the United States and other Western industrialized countries, very little is known about the subclass structure for antisocial behavior among youth growing up in other geographical contexts. Using validated measures of aggression, psychopathy, and low self-control, we employ latent class analysis to identify latent subgroups of antisocial behavior from a sample of 324 Saudi Arabian youth. Three classes of antisocial behavior emerged and significant associations between latent class membership and different forms of delinquency were observed. The findings are the first to show a similar pattern of latent class formation for antisocial behavior and risk for violent and nonviolent delinquency among Saudi Arabian youth compared to U.S. youth.",

    "title": "KCNA4 deficiency leads to a syndrome of abnormal striatum, congenital cataract and intellectual disability",
    "abstract": "Background: Voltage-gated potassium channels are highly diverse proteins representing the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from structural and functional perspectives. Deficiency of these channels usually results in various human disorders. Objectives: To describe a novel autosomal recessive syndrome associated with KCNA4 deficiency leading to congenital cataract, abnormal striatum, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Methods: We used SNP arrays, linkage analyses, autozygosity mapping, whole-exome sequencing, RT-PCR and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording. Results: We identified a missense variant (p.Arg89Gln) in KCNA4 in four patients from a consanguineous family manifesting a novel syndrome of congenital cataract, abnormal striatum, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The variant was fully segregated with the disease and absent in 747 ethnically matched exomes. Xenopus oocytes were injected with human Kv1.4 wild-type mRNA, R89Q and WT/R89Q channels. The wild type had mean current amplitude that was significantly greater than those recorded from the cells expressing the same amount of mutant mRNA. Co-expression of the wild type and mutant mRNAs resulted in mean current amplitude that was significantly different from that of the wild type. RT-PCR indicated that KCNA4 is present in mouse brain, lens and retina. KCNA4 interacts with several molecules including synaptotagmin I, DLG1 and DLG2. The channel co-localises with cholinergic amacrine and rod bipolar cells in rats and is widely distributed in the central nervous system. Based on previous studies, the channel is highly expressed in outer retina, rod inner segments, hippocampus and concentrated in axonal membranes. Conclusion: KCNA4 (Kv1.4) is implicated in a novel syndrome characterised by striatal thinning, congenital cataract and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Our study highlights potassium channels&rsquo; role in ocular and neuronal genetics.",

    "abstract": "This research study aims at investigating the impact of Mind Maps on modifying the lack of attention in Arabic language class among Saudi Kindergarten children. To achieve the goals of this study the researcher used an experimental design with a random sample from AlRae&quot;d Kindergarten&quot;s children in Riyadh -Saudi Arabia for the academic year (2014-2015). The study sample consisted of (40) children divided into two groups: (23) in the experimental and (17) in the control group. The researcher used Al-Obeidi&quot;s (1999) Lack of Attention Scale LAS. Validity of the tool was approved through a half division to measure lack of attention (0.93) which is considered good. The scale was used before and after the implementation of the experiment on both groups. Results showed a positive change in attention concentration in favor of the experimental group. Thus, the researcher recommended the use of Mind Maps in teaching kindergarten children to avoid attention deficiency.",

    "title": "Neurobehavioral outcomes of school-age children born preterm: a preliminary study in the Arabic community",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Preterm survivors from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are considered as high risk group for some neurobehavioral impairments such as cognitive disabilities, developmental delays, social/ emotional limitations, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and academic difficulties. Objective: The current study aimed to investigate the neurobehavioral outcome of premature infants in Saudi Arabia at the school age. Methods: At the school age, preterm children (range 23-29 weeks or ≤ 1.52 kg) born from April, 2006 through September, 2008, and who were admitted following birth to a NICU, were evaluated with several neurobehavioral tools. Results: This study includes 53 preterm children, who were followed up at the chronological age that ranged from 6.4-8.0 years. The results of the neurobehavioral assessments showed in general normal social adaptive levels and cognitive abilities, with mean total score of about 91.0 and 90.0, respectively. The prevalence of ADHD among preterm children was high, with result of 34.0% for the inattentive type and 11.3% for the hyperactive/ impulsive type. None of the preterm children repeats a grade, but 22.6% utilize a form of special educational supports. Some of the preterm children showed poor school performance in reading skills, writing skills and mathematics skills, with percentages of 26.4%, 28.3% and 15.1%, respectively. Conclusions: The present results emphasize that preterm children are a group of high-risk children who need regular follow-up to track the developmental conditions and to provide the early developmental intervention for optimal outcome.",

    "title": "Patterns of psychotropic medication use in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings in Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Objective: To study the pattern of psychotropic medication use and compare this pattern between inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings in Saudi Arabia. Method: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted between July 2012 and June 2014 on patients seeking psychiatric advice at major hospitals in five main regions of Saudi Arabia. Male (n=651) and female (n=594) patients who signed the informed consent form and were currently or had been previously using psychotropic medications, irrespective of the patients type of psychiatric diagnosis and duration of the disease, were included. A total of 1,246 patients were found to be suitable in the inclusion criteria of whom 464 were inpatients while 782 were outpatients. Results: Several studied demographic factors have shown that compared with outpatients, inpatients were more likely to be male (P=0.004), unmarried (P,0.001), have less number of children (1-3; P=0.002), unemployed (P=0.001), have a lower family income (,3,000 SR; P,0.001), live in rural communities (P,0.001), have a lower body mass index (P=0.001), and are smokers (P,0.001); however, there were no differences with regard to age or educational levels. The current frequency of use of psychotropic medications in overall patients was antipsychotics (76.6%), antidepressants (41.4%), mood stabilizers (27.9%), and anti-anxiety (6.2%). However, compared to outpatients, the current use of medications for inpatients was more frequent (93.8% vs 89.9%, P=0.019) with inpatients more likely to be treated with multiple medications (2.1 vs 1.8 medications). A similar trend was observed in the case of antipsychotics, high potency 1st-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and anti-anxiety medicines where inpatients were more frequently treated with these medications for all psychiatric diagnoses when compared with outpatients. On the contrary, in the case of antidepressant treatment, an opposite trend was observed with more number of treated outpatients in comparison to inpatients. Among elderly patients, 75.9% received antipsychotics, mainly second-generation formulations (67.2%), whereas only 41% received antidepressants and 13.8% received mood stabilizers. Conclusion: Based upon the present study data, it is concluded that among all the psychotropic medications, antipsychotics were heavily used and the frequency was found to be significantly high in the case of inpatients compared with outpatients. Such a practice may lead to multiple negative consequences among the Saudi psychiatric patient population. Further, extensive use of sodium valproate in the case of bipolar disorder, and also among females either in childbearing age or during pregnancy is also the cause of concern and warrants logical use. Overall, this study may help in assessing the burden of psychiatric illness within specific patient demographics and might be effectively used to strategically plan health resources allocation, generate new treatment hypothesis, or be used as a source of evidence that could further integrate other observational studies.",

It enrolled a total of 112 Saudi school children (62 boys, 50 girls; mean age = 9.26 years, SD = 1.98) of which 51 were diagnosed with ADHD and 61 typically developing peers. Data on children&quot;s social informational processing and type of aggression displayed were gathered and analyzed for group differences by diagnosis and gender within diagnosis. Findings suggest gaps in social information processing and elevated aggression levels among children with ADHD compared to typical others. Male children with ADHD to present mostly with proactive aggression and self-serving information processing. Female ADHD were characterized by reactive aggression and selective information processing. Implicit socialization processes might explain the differences in social information processing and type of aggression among male and female students with Arabic culture background.",

    "abstract": "Background: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in children and adolescents is prevalent with pain as a common component, and has a comorbidity with psychosocial problems such as stress, depression, anxiety as well as somatic complaints. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate if psychosocial problems in children and adolescents are associated with TMD with pain (TMD-pain) and TMD without pain (TMD-painfree) when compared to children and adolescents without TMD. Methods: This cross-sectional study consisted of 456 randomly selected children and adolescents, enrolled from 10 boy's- and 10 girl's- schools in Jeddah, between 10 and 18 years of age. On the examination day, prior to the clinical examination according to Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD Axis I and II, the participants first answered two validated questions about TMD pain, and after that the Arabic version of the Youth Self Report scale. According to their clinical examination and diagnosis the participants were divided into three groups; non-TMD group, TMD-pain group, and TMD-painfree group. Results: The TMD-pain group presents a higher frequency of the internalizing problems anxiety, depression and somatic complaints than non-TMD group (p Conclusions: TMD-pain in children and adolescents does not seem to affect the social activities. However, TMD-pain seem to have a strong association to emotional, behavior and somatic functioning, with higher frequencies of anxiety, depression, somatic problems, aggressive behavior and thought problems, than children and adolescents without TMD-pain. With respect to the biopsychosocial model the present study indicates that there are significant associations to psychosocial, somatic and behavioral comorbidities and TMD-pain in children and adolescents in the Middle East region.",

    "title": "The Comorbidity between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Children and Arabic Speech Sound Disorder",
    "abstract": "Children with Attention-Deficiency/Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) often have co-existing learning disabilities and developmental weaknesses or delays in some areas including speech (Rief, 2005). Seeing that phonological disorders include articulation errors and other forms of speech disorders, studies pertaining to children with ADHD symptoms who demonstrate signs of phonological disorders in their native Arabic language are lacking. The purpose of this study is to provide a description of Arabic language deficits and to present a theoretical model of potential associations between phonological language deficits and ADHD. Dodd and McCormack&quot;s (1995) four subgroups classification of speech disorder and the phonological disorders pertaining to the Arabic language provided by a Saudi Institute for Speech and Hearing are examined within the theoretical framework. Since intervention may improve articulation and focuses a child&quot;s attention on the sound structure of words, findings in this study are based on the assumption that children with ADHD may acquire phonology for their Arabic language in the same way, and following the same developmental stages as intelligible children. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses have proven that the ADHD group analyzed in this study had indeed failed to acquire most of their Arabic consonants as they should have.",

    "abstract": "A considerable amount of research has examined patterns of substance use and the potential explanations of it among samples from the United States and other industrialized nations. To date, however, no research has explored these issues in a sample of Saudi Arabian youth. The current study addressed this gap in the literature and examined the lifetime use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among Saudi Arabian youth. We also examined whether key measures from social learning theory and low self-control theory were able to account for patterns of usage. Data drawn from a sample of nearly 500 youth residing in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were used. Analysis of the data revealed that 12.7% of youth had smoked cigarettes at least 1 time, 2.6% had consumed alcohol at least once, and 3.0% had used illegal drugs. Moreover, the results of rare-events logistic regression revealed that a measure of delinquent peers was the strongest and most consistent predictor of substance use, while a measure of low self-control was unrelated (or related in a direction opposite to that which was predicted) to the measures of substance use.",

    "title": "The Need for Teaching Strategies for Students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at Saudi Arabian Schools",
    "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is prevalent in schools around the world today. Over 1.6 million Saudi children suffer from ADD/ADHD today, which is comparable with other nations. Roughly 11% of US students are effected by ADHD and 15% of Saudi students. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Education has approved the implementation of ADD/ADHD programs in schools. However, teachers in Saudi Arabia are not well prepared to work with the issues that they are facing in their classrooms with these students. Both teachers and parents can benefit from learning new strategies to work with their ADD/ADHD students. The lack of proper instructional strategies employed and understanding of the disorder cause students to fall behind and struggle academically. There are many simple resources that teachers can tap into for help; however, many are not prepared to teach students with ADHD. This study seeks to gather information through survey questionnaires and research regarding teacher's as well as student advisor's understanding and perspectives of ADD/ADHD and to provide information in order to bring awareness of different types of strategies for Saudi teachers, student advisors and parents to implement with elementary, middle, and high school students in their academic achievements. This project also seeks to develop a program and Guidebook for teachers and parents to use providing information and instructional strategies to help them with students with ADD/ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Student counseling programs can provide many benefits to students in schools all around the world. In theory, the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) has committed itself to school counseling programs in educational institutions throughout the country. Student counselors face a number of burdens and obstacles that impact student counseling programs. It is also widely known that Saudi Arabia has extremely high prevalence rates for overweight and obesity, anxiety and depression, and diabetes in children. It has also been demonstrated that teachers and staff are inadequately prepared when dealing with health issues relating to diabetes in schools in Saudi Arabia. this study will clearly demonstrate how student counselors in Saudi Arabia could become 'New Educators' in Saudi schools in relation to these health issues. This would allow them to leverage their position as student counselor to improve the quality of care provided to schools children, and to overcome burdens and obstacles that are currently negatively affecting student counseling in Saudi schools. scholar.waset.org/1999.10/10005489",

    "title": "The Possible Impact of Interlocutor Familiarity on Verbal Interaction in Children with ADHD",
    "abstract": "Previous research studies have suggested that interlocutor differences have both a quantitative and qualitative impact on Typically Developing (TD) children\"s verbal interaction. At the same time the research literature was not so clear when it comes to the influence of interlocutor differences on the verbal interaction of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The current research study investigated the impact of the interlocutor familiarity on both the TD and ADHD Subgroups using quantitative approach. This was achieved by testing whether or not there was a statistically significant difference in the total number of words during the session, total number of verbal turns, average number of words per turn, and the average number of words per minute during the FI-child (Familiar Interlocutor-child) interaction compared to the UI-child (Unfamiliar Interlocutor-child) interaction. It was expected that interlocutor familiarity would have a greater impact on the ADHD group. The participants were twenty 4-5 year old boys. The were TD and ten had diagnosis of ADHD. A speech sample during free play was collected from each child in conversation with UI and FI in two separate sessions. All sessions were audio-visual recorded using two video cameras. Transcriptions and coding systems were used to analyse the data. Comparisons were made between the TD children and the children with ADHD using quantitative techniques. The results of the quantitative study for the interlocutor impact showed no significant effect of interlocutor was found. Between-group comparison showed no significant difference between the UI and the FI sessions in either the ADHD group or the TD group at the level of the total number of words, the total number of verbal turns, the average number of words per turn, or the average number of words per minute. It was predicted that children with ADHD would be more sensitive than TD to the interlocutor factor but the results of the current study showed that the children with ADHD are not different from TD children in terms of the difference between UI and FI sessions. On the other hand, the TD children were obviously more verbal quantitatively in terms of number of words and turns produced during the UI and the FI sessions. It was observed that during the UI and FI sessions with the children with ADHD, some interlocutors, especially mothers, were sitting quietly watching the children with ADHD playing, without trying again to communicate after a communication failure. The ADHD mothers in the current study may have expected less out of them at the verbal level.

    "title": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Children with Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECT)",
    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study is to estimate the occurrence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children with Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) Background: Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) is the most common idiopathic focal epilepsy in children. ADHD is a common comorbidity in children with epilepsy especially BECT. Children with epilepsy and ADHD are likely to be at higher risk for more negative outcomes in school and terms of quality of life compared with children with epilepsy alone. Methods: This is a prospective hospital based study targeting a group of children who were diagnosed to have BECT and has been followed in neurology outpatient clinic at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for four years from December 2010 - December 2014. BECT was diagnosed based on Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy,1989. Children with neurometabolic, neurodegenerative disorders, mental retardation and evidence of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy were excluded. All children included in the study were evaluated for ADHD by clinical evaluation and administering Vanderbilt scale. Results: Thirty four patients were enrolled, the age range from 6 -12 years, male 19 (56%) female 15 (44%). Age of seizure onset 3-12 years. Six children (17.6%) has ADHD. Three has Attention type represent (50%), and three patients has combined Attention with hyperactivity (50%). Twenty children(59%) were on antiepileptic drugs. The seizure was well controlled in all patients. Conclusion: ADHD is a common comorbidity in children with BECT. Patient with BECT should be routinely screened for ADHD. Applying scale like Vanderbilt scale for assessing the presence of ADHD in BECT patients is a good initial screening scale followed by proper psychiatric evaluation.",

The literature has identified a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in Saudi school children and adolescent students. Student counselling practices are effective in helping students with a wide range of social and behavioural problems. The aim of the research study was to conduct an evidence-based review of the literature in order to provide new and innovative approaches to developing and improving student counselling skills, methods, and frameworks in order to directly combat anxiety and depression in Saudi schools. Non-empirical qualitative review of the literature on anxiety and depression and on student counselling in the United Kingdom and in Saudi Arabia. Main Argument: The research study argues that in theory student counsellors in Saudi schools can help to direct address and reduce the existing high prevalence of anxiety and depression in youths and adolescents attending Saudi schools. The research study concludes that student counselling in Saudi schools could potentially help in directly combating and reducing levels of anxiety and depression among Saudi school children and adolescents.",

    "title": "Furnishing and Indoor Environment for Hyperactivity and Distracted Attention (in the Context of Sustainable Design)",
    "abstract": "Non-government institutions have been upgrading the level of services provided to people with special needs since their numbers have increased worldwide, due to the recognition of new diseases, such as hyperactivity, distracted attention and learning difficulties, which increase in number annually. The main aim of the research is to investigate the criteria of furniture design and class arrangement which reflect the needs and desires of students with ADHD and staff, but unfortunately, schools are often designed and built without fully considering the needs of the community who uses them. Such considerations contribute to develop their ability to learn, i.e. create an appropriate and compatible learning environment with student&quot;s abilities to enhance academic performance. To achieve the aim of the research, the researcher reviewed the literature and previous research to identify: 1- the characteristics and behaviour of ADHA students, as well as the patterns of their movement behaviour in the classrooms; 2- the problems of the students and teachers, which are related to dealing with the elements of furniture. The researcher conducted a field study to observe the behaviour of a group of students, as well as the problems related to the elements of furniture. This is in addition to an interview with a group of specialists to deal with such students. However, this methodology depends on exploring possible options for choosing suitable materials. Since there are many options for choosing sustainable materials that have garnered little attention, material efficiency, using less new materials to achieve the same goals is a rich opportunity to create sufficient spaces for students who suffer from hyperactivity and distracted attention. The research method involved a selected sample of teachers of ADHD students aged from 4 to 12 years from five schools in Riyadh. The aim of this study is to develop design criteria that reflects the foundations and considerations of interior design in the context of the Saudi Code of designing special places for people with special needs according to principles of sustainable material use.",

This was a cross-sectional study aimed at surveying teachers' knowledge about attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, one of the most prevailing neurodevelopmental disorders. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirteen female elementary school teachers were randomly chosen from six regular female public and private schools in Al-Khobar in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. They completed a self-reported questionnaire on their general \"factual\" knowledge of the nature of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and the management \"action knowledge\" of the condition. Factors which might affect their knowledge were also examined. Results: About 48.7% of the total sample had adequate factual knowledge, but only 27 (23.9%) showed adequate action knowledge about how to deal with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Teachers' knowledge of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (factual and action) was not significantly correlated with their years of experience, level of education (qualification) and duration of training in educational methodology. Conclusion: It was concluded that teachers in female primary schools had inadequate knowledge about attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Implications and recommendation for health and educational professional are outlined.",

    "title": "Systematic review of the epidemiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Arab countries",
    "abstract": "Objectives: To assess the epidemiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Arab countries, and identify gaps for future research. Methods: We searched PubMed from July 1978 to July 2014 and reviewed local journals with cross- referencing. The keywords we used were ADHD, diagnosis, prevalence, incidence, factor, diagnosis, rate, risk, and each of the names of the 22 Arab countries (Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and so on). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated the epidemiology of ADHD in any Arab country, and were published in English. The search was conducted from 2nd to 5th August 2014 in King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Results: A total of 22 articles were included in the review. Twenty studies were cross-sectional and found the prevalence of ADHD ranged between 1.3-16%, prevalence of hyperactive type ADHD between 1.4-7.8%, and the prevalence of inattention type between 2.1-2.7%. Only 2 case-control studies investigated potential risk factors. Evidence extracted from these studies shows a significant association between ADHD and male gender, previous psychiatric illness in the family, vitamin D deficiency, poor school performance, sleep problems, and nocturnal enuresis. Conclusions: The prevalence of ADHD in Arab countries is comparable to reports in North America, Africa, and other countries of the Middle East. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the prognosis and determinants of this condition in the Arab world.",

    "title": "The Impact of Parents’ Medication Beliefs on ADHD Management",
    "abstract": "Adherence behaviour to medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently suboptimal. Parents have several beliefs and experiences about ADHD medication and they going to make their decisions based on that background. This study aims to investigate qualitatively the parental experiences regarding using medication of ADHD for their children with ADHD. A qualitative approach was chosen to gain an in-depth insight into the experiences and beliefs. The investigations approached more than 60 parents during their follow-up. And the final sample included 44 parents. Parents generally were reluctant to medicate their children. Some parents revealed positive experiences about ADHD’s medication, mainly when that medication associated with positive performance at their schools. Parents described their hesitancy to continue the medication as a result of having uncertain assessments, side-effects of that medication and stigma. It was rare to hear from parents that behavioural or educational intervention could be used to manage ADHD, mainly when they decide to discontinue medication. There is a need to develop intervention program that educate, encourage, and support parents in following behaviour and pharmacological recommendations.",

    "title": "Towards an ICF core set for ADHD: a worldwide expert survey on ability and disability",
    "abstract": "This is the second in a series of four empirical studies designed to develop International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF and Children and Youth version, ICF-CY) core sets for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objective of this stage was to gather the opinions from international experts on which ability and disability concepts were considered relevant to functioning in ADHD. An email-based survey was carried out amongst international experts in ADHD. Relevant functional ability and disability concepts were extracted from their responses and linked to the ICF/-CY categories by two independent researchers using a standardised linking procedure. 174 experts from 11 different disciplines and 45 different countries completed the survey. Meaningful concepts identified in their responses were linked to 185 ICF/-CY categories. Of these, 83 categories were identified by at least 5 % of the experts and considered the most relevant to ADHD: 30 of these were related to Body functions (most identified: attention functions, 85 %), 30 to Activities and Participation (most identified: school education, 52 %), 20 to Environmental factors (most identified: support from immediate family, 61 %), and 3 to Body structures (most identified: structure of brain, 83 %). Experts also provided their views on particular abilities related to ADHD, naming characteristics such as high-energy levels, flexibility and resiliency. Gender differences in the expression of ADHD identified by experts pertained mainly to females showing more internalising (e.g. anxiety, low self-esteem) and less externalising behaviours (e.g. hyperactivity), leading to a risk of late- and under-diagnosis in females. Results indicate that the impact of ADHD extends beyond the core symptom domains, into all areas of life and across the lifespan. The current study in combination with three additional preparatory studies (comprehensive scoping review, focus groups, clinical study) will provide the scientific basis to define the ADHD ICF/-CY core sets for multi-purpose use in basic and applied research and every day clinical practice.",

This paper offers a number of different considerations surrounding the formation and development of the socio-political context of studies in the Educational domain. This paper also centres on local, national, international, discursive and social; therefore, it is necessary for a researcher to ensure the awareness of all of these aspects when carrying out a study. The Saudi context, in this vein, is known to be concerned about the necessity to verify the background and foundation of ADHD in Saudi Arabia. It is recognized that, an overview in this arena would enable the readers to develop an understanding of the context in which the study is carried out. This research attempts to explain the importance and recommend the parents to be involved with children\"s ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) in Saudi Arabia.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to determine the association between vitamin D and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and difference in the level of vitamin D in ADHD children and control. This a case- control study carried out in school health and primary health care clinics. A total of 1,331 children and adoles- cents who were diagnosed with ADHD based on clinical criteria and standardized questionnaires were enrolled in this study and were matched with 1,331 controls, aged 5-18 years old. Data on body mass index (BMI), clinical biochemistry variables including serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were collected. The study found significant association between ADHD and vitamin D deficiency after adjusting for BMI and sex (adj. OR 1.54; 95 % CI 1.32-1.81; P &#92; 0.001). Majority of the ADHD children were in the age group 5-10 years (40.7 %), followed by 11-13 years (38.4 %). The proportion of BMI &#92;85th percentile was significantly over represented in ADHD group as compared to healthy control (87.8 vs. 83 %; P &#92; 0.001, respectively), while on the other hand, BMI [95th percentile was over represented in the control than ADHD group (7.6 vs. 4.6 %; P &#92; 0.001, respectively). Mean values of vitamin D (ng/mL) were significantly lower in ADHD children (16.6 &plusmn; 7.8) than in healthy children (23.5 &plusmn; 9.0) (P &#92; 0.001). There was significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and age (r = -0.191, P = 0.001); calcium (r = 0.272, P = 0.001); phosphorous (r = 0.284, P = 0.001); magnesium (r = 0.292, P = 0.001); and BMI (r = 0.498, P = 0.001) in ADHD children.

    "abstract": "Background and Aim: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood mental disorders that manifest with difficulties in staying focused and hyperactivity. Such children have been reported to have a higher incidence of traumatic dental injuries. The aim of this article was to study the knowledge and attitude of Saudi teachers of children with ADHD towards the management of traumatic dental injuries and compare them to their counterparts in mainstream schools. Material and Methods: A four-part structured Arabic questionnaire was administered to 281 teachers of children with ADHD and 384 teachers in mainstream schools. The questionnaire recorded the demographic data, type of children taught, experience of the teacher in dealing with traumatic dental injuries, the teachers&rsquo; perceived importance of managing traumatic dental injuries and their knowledge of emergency management of these injuries. The difference in knowledge and attitude between teachers of mainstream schools and schools for children with ADHD was assessed. Results and Conclusions: The results of the study indicate that teachers of children with ADHD have a greater experience of witnessing traumatic dental injuries and place significantly more importance towards the management of these injuries than their counterparts in mainstream schools. The influence of demographic variables on knowledge seen in teachers from mainstream schools is absent in those teaching children with ADHD.",

It affects 3-7% of school-aged children, interfering with their academic performance and social interactions. This study explored the knowledge and beliefs of teachers in Saudi Arabia about children with ADHD. The Knowledge about Attention Deficit Disorder Questionnaire (KADD-Q) was administered to a sample of teachers, followed by interviews with a subset of the total respondents. The results indicated that the teachers knew more about the characteristics of ADHD than they knew about its related causes and treatment. Overall, the findings indicated that these teachers had some knowledge about general characteristics of ADHD, but they had little understanding of causes and possible interventions. These results suggest an important need for more formal teacher training regarding all aspects of ADHD in school-age children.",

The rationale behind this study is the exploration of the knowledge and beliefs of children regarding ADHD. The results of the survey based on the responses of 58 children to the ADHD Knowledge and Opinions Questionnaires and subsequent interviews showed positive choices of evidence-based medication and psychosocial treatment, and an understanding of the range of effects of ADHD, and the possible handling strategies. Children were able to determine environments in which ADHD made it difficult for them to be, and also identify adults who they considered capable of assisting them with their condition. Overall, the findings reveal that, whilst children have some knowledge regarding ADHD, demystification workshops are required.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Among childhood mental disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common yet under diagnosed condition. Few studies have addressed this problem in Saudi Arabia. Objectives: To assess proportion of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) positive students among primary school children in Sabia City, Jizan and study their personal characteristics. Subjects and Methods: Four primary schools in Sabia City were randomly selected. A total of 200 pupils (100 boys and 100 girls) were included in this study. Data collection tools included the personal characteristics questionnaire and the Arabic version of the ADHD Rating Scale. Results: A total of 13.5% of students were positive regarding ADHD, with higher percentage of positive results among male than female students (15% vs. 12%, respectively). Younger students had higher percentage of positive results than older students. Highest percentage of positive results were observed among students who were first born (20.7%) followed by those who were last born (14.8%). Students whose fathers were illiterate had the highest proportion of positive results (31.3%), while students whose mothers were illiterate had significantly highest proportion of positive results (40.8%, p10 members had the highest proportion of positive results. Conclusions: ADHD is common among primary school children in Sabia City. Symptoms of ADHD are more among boys than girls. There is higher proportion of ADHD symptoms among school children whose mothers are illiterate.",

Data are reported from a wide range of sources, including the 2007 Saudi Arabian Mental and Social Health Atlas, which compares services in KSA with the rest of the world. Results: We examine how the current mental health system operates in KSA, including recent changes in mental healthcare policy and development of a national mental healthcare plan. Discussed are current needs based on the prevalence and recognition of mental disorders; availability of services and providers (psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, psychologists, and social workers); education and training in psychiatry; developments in consultation-liaison, addictions, child-adolescent, and geriatric psychiatry; and progress in mental health research. Conclusions: Mental healthcare in Saudi Arabia has come a long way in a very short time, despite cultural, religious, social, and political challenges, although there still remain areas where improvement is needed. The development of psychiatry in KSA serves as a model for countries in the Middle East and around the world.",

Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional multistage stratified survey was carried out on schoolgirls aged 12-19 years. The total sample was 512 girls (291 and 221 girls from government and private schools, respectively). A pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Findings - The findings revealed that girls in private schools were significantly more likely to consume vegetables, fruits, red meat, and chicken than those in government schools. Furthermore, private schoolgirls were less prone to watch television and use the internet daily than girls in government schools. Originality/value - Intervention for promoting healthy lifestyles in schoolchildren should not exclude private schools.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of Health Educational Program on Parents’ Coping Strategies and their Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
    "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is considered the most common psychiatric disorder that. (ADHD) is a developmental condition that involves problems with inattention and hyperactivity- impulsivity inconsistent with the age of the child. The affected child often has difficulty learning, giving rise to special educational needs that, combined with poor peer and family relationship, can lead to lack of self-esteem. Because the nature of illness is unknown, parents are usually not aware of how the illness will be managed. So the present study aimed to identify the effectiveness of health educational program on parents' coping strategies and their children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. A quasi-experimental design was utilized in this study. The study has been carried out in the Psychiatric Out-patient Clinic in Al-Amal Complex for Mental Health in Dammam. A total sample of (30) parents and their children with ADHD has been selected. Pre-post assessment were carried out using the following tools: Socio demographic data sheet for both: parents and children. Knowledge assessment was measured by Psychosocial Problems of Parents Scale. developed by Pruyn, 1983 . The last one is The Parental Coping Strategy Inventory (PCSI)Yeh. The result of the current study revealed a statistically significant difference in level of parents knowledge and coping strategies between pre-post assessment. Therefore, researchers recommended the necessity to increase the awareness of illness by health care professionals through counseling, family therapy, free work shops for parents because they really in need.",

The paper also presents a general background of the Saudi legislation in terms of the major elements of this legislation and its similarities with and differences from the IDEA. Additionally, this paper investigates the problems in implementing the Regulations of Special Education Programs and Institutes (RSEPI) and the reasons behind these issues. Furthermore, the researcher develops a set of regulations that address the elements of problems in the implementation of the RSEPI. This paper also identifies some ways that might be considered by the policy makers, media, educators, and professional organizations that assist in informing the teachers (special and regular), administrators, related service personnel and families of children with disabilities about these regulations. Finally, the researcher modifies and suggests a system of accountability that assists the schools and school districts with complying with the regulations of the RSEPI.",

The findings of the study reveal that the prevalence of ADHD was estimated to be 11.6%. The subtypes results indicate: a prevalence of 6.3% for ADD, a prevalence of 2.2% for HD. The third type that is the combined hyperactive/ impulsive and inattentive type of ADHD has a prevalence of 3.1%. The results show that there is a difference between ADHD prevalence among elementary school children due to the difference in age. Furthermore, the total prevalence percentage of ADHD for female students was (4.2%). The total prevalence percentage of ADHD for male students was (7.4%).",

    "title": "Teacher Knowledge Training and Acceptance of Students with ADHD in their Classrooms Qatar Case Study",
    "abstract": "The presence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is similar to other neurological disorders of the brain in that it lacks a simple specific blood or other straightforward test to confirm the disorder. Parent and teacher rating scales are the standard measure of the presence of ADHD. Most referrals to medical professionals for an ADHD assessment are made by the student&quot;s teacher. Qatar schools are staffed differently than other countries in the region, with less than 25% of teachers being local Qataris. Given the appointment of teachers from surrounding nations, there is a lack of quality control for teacher preparation with each nation setting their own standards for teacher education and professional development. Without adequate knowledge of ADHD, teachers may not be able to accurately complete the teacher rating scales needed by medical professionals to assist in confirming a diagnosis of ADHD. Therefore, it is important that teachers understand the characteristics of ADHD, and that ADHD is a neurobiological disorder. This descriptive study explores teacher knowledge and perceptions of ADHD. The instrument for this study was derived from the Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorders Scale (KADDS) adapted to fit the local Qatari context and study objectives. Participants were recruited from a random sample of Qatar Independent Schools. Frequency distributions and t-tests were conducted to determine ranges of responses, and relationships between responses and four demographic variables. Results are reported for demographics, teacher knowledge and teacher perceptions and beliefs. The results suggest that current clinical and scientific knowledge of the symptoms, causes and treatment of ADHD is not included in teacher preparation or professional development programs. Thus the ability of teachers to assess eligible students and to monitor medications for students with ADHD comes under question. Promising results include the fact that many teachers reported that they did not know the answers to more than 35% of the survey questions and therefore their knowledge and attitudes may be more readily influenced through workshops and in service programs.",

    "title": "Teachers’ Knowledge and Misconceptions of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder",
    "abstract": "Teachers can play a key role in identifying and supporting students with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In order to fulfill this important role, it is imperative for teachers to have explicit knowledge about ADHD. The overall aim of this study is to investigate teachers knowledge and misconceptions of ADHD. Four hundred and twenty-nine (429) teachers participated. The Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (KADDS) along with a demographic questionnaire was used as the survey instruments to collect data. Descriptive statistics and correlation test were used to analyze the data. Results indicated that teachers knowledge of ADHD was insufficient. Teachers level of knowledge of ADHD was positively related to their prior training and experience with ADHD (i.e., the number of ADHD courses taken in college or graduate level, and the number of workshops pertaining to ADHD). Teachers level of knowledge of ADHD also correlated positively with their level of confidence in teaching a student with ADHD. In spite of a few limitations, the results of this study are valuable for identifying areas where there is a misperception or lack of knowledge among teachers.",

    "title": "Association study between the dopamine-related candidate gene polymorphisms and ADHD among Saudi Arabia population via PCR technique",
    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood behavioral disorders characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. In Saudi Arabia the prevalence of combined ADHD is 16.4 %. ADHD etiology is not clear and not completely understood. There are several evidences for involvement of dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathogenesis of ADHD. Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA) is involved in the degradation of all three of these neurotransmitters. Dopamine Transporter 1 (DAT1) plays an important role in controlling blood levels of dopamine. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between ADHD and polymorphisms of MAOA 30 bp-promoter VNTR and DAT1 40 bp 3_ UTRVNTR in Saudi population. PCR technique was employed to detect polymorphisms of MAOA and DAT1 genes in a sample of 120 ADHD subjects and 160 controls. Alleles and genotypes frequencies for both of MAOA and DAT1 polymorphisms were compared among ADHD subjects against controls. Association between ADHD and alleles as well as genotypes for each studied polymorphisms was tested by odds ratio (OR) test and the magnitude of this association was estimated by 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). A significant association was found between two MAOA genotypes 3/4 and 3/2 with ADHD (P < 0.01, OR = 3, 4.9) as a risk effect. No significant association was found with MAOA alleles. Among DAT1 polymorphisms two alleles (7 and 11 repeats) (P < 0.01, OR = 2.5 and 3.3) as well as two genotypes (11/11 and 11/7) (P < 0.01, OR = 4, 3) showed significant association with ADHD as a risk effect. On the contrary, 9 and 10 repeats revealed significant association as a protective effect as well as 10/10 and 10/9 genotypes. These findings support the hypothesis that some of the MAOA and DAT1 polymorphisms have a causative role in the development of ADHD in the Saudi population. Another polymorphism did not give rise to support this hypothesis. This is the first report investigated the association between MAOA and DAT1 polymorphism at molecular level in Saudi Arabia population as well as Arab world. Therefore further studies are needed to generalize obtained results at Saudi Arabia.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccumulating evidence suggests an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the Middle East. In this context, we aimed to determine whether the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is related to degree of physical activity and sun exposure among apparently healthy Saudi children and adolescents, a little studied population.MethodsA total of 331 Saudi children aged 6–17 years (153 boys and 178 girls) were included in this cross sectional study. Levels of physical activity and sun exposure were determined using a standard questionnaire. Anthropometry, serum calcium and 25-(OH) vitamin D were analyzed.ResultsAll subjects were vitamin D deficient, the majority being moderately deficient (71.6%). Age was the single most significant predictor affecting 25 (OH) Vitamin D levels, explaining 21% of the variance perceived (p = 1.68 x 10-14). Age-matched comparisons revealed that for groups having the same amount of sun exposure, those with moderate or are physically active will have higher levels of vitamin D status, though levels in across groups remained deficient.ConclusionVitamin D deficiency is common among Saudi children and adolescents, and is influenced by both sun exposure and physical activity. Promotion of an active outdoor lifestyle among Saudi children in both homes and schools may counteract the vitamin D deficiency epidemic in this vulnerable population. Vitamin D supplementation is suggested in all groups, including those with the highest sun exposure and physical activity.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To assess the progression of mental health research over four decades in the Arab world. Methods: Publications on mental health in 21 Arab countries from 1966 to 2006 were screened using PubMed and Psychinfo. Data were collected and analyzed for Arab authors and affiliations, publication year, topic and type of journal. Results: In 40 years (1966-2005), the Arab world published 2,213 articles on a vast variety of topics, most common being mood, anxiety and substance use disorders, and mostly in international journals. By the last decade, the total yearly publications increased about eightfold since the first two decades, and nearly doubled from the third one. The disparity of output was high across countries. The highest yearly output was from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Lebanon. Per million population, the top four producing countries were Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon and United Arab Emirates. Conclusions: Over a decade, the Arab world produced approximately 17% of the global output of mental health publications/million population and was comparative to Latin American and Caribbean countries. There is a wide gap in comparison with the industrialized world, with a fertile ground for cross-cultural and genetic studies.",

    "title": "The Acquisition of Discourse Markers in Arabic First Language Acquisition: A Case Study of a Saudi ADHD Child",
    "abstract": "The present study investigated the acquisition of discourse markers as being part of complex structures by an Arab monolingual ADHD child, who is also a late talker. The selected child is the offspring of one of the researchers. The child had been observed since the age of five and four months to the age of seven (20 months); his conversations with his mother and family members were tape- recorded, and phonetically transcribed for analysis. The study has three main concerns: first, to examine and analyze systematically the acquisition of discourse markers in Arabic in ADHD children; secondly, trace the type of deviance and the number of deviant structures uttered by the child. Thus, we can see how long it takes the child to overcome the gap and acquire these structures as part of his language inventory. Results indicated that the verbal production of the child significantly exhibits fewer discourse markers which result in loosely connected utterances and less organized structures, i.e. ADHD children are more likely than other children to produce ungrammatical structures and less cohesive utterances. Moreover, the order of the acquisition of some connectives is in line with the literature of typical language development, nonetheless, the child was found late in his acquisition of these discourse markers. In addition, the analysis of the redundant deviant constructions indicated that the child\"s employed a number of systematic strategies (omission and/or substitution) in the formation of ungrammatical structures. It is hoped that the obtained results will contribute to the literature of first language acquisition as well as the comorbidity of ADHD and delayed language development in the affected children by providing insights into (i) how first language acquisition proceeds in an ADHD child, and (ii) how speech delay, the most common co-morbid disorder, affects normative language development of an ADHD child, by specifying and analyzing the type as well as the redundancy of deviant structures in his speech.",

The aim of this study was to find out the value of aerobic exercises on improvement symptoms of ADHD patients.\n\nMaterials and Methods: This study included 84 students diagnosed as having ADHD. Their age ranged from eleven to sixteen years. The students were randomly divided into two equal groups. The exercise group received ten weeks aerobic exercises program included upper limb, lower limb, trunk and neck exercises as well as running three sessions per week (In the first four weeks the session lasted for about 40 minutes and in the last six weeks the session extended to be 50 minutes). Behavior Rating scale was used to assess the students behavior before starting and after the end of ten weeks of the exercise program.\n\nResults: Results of the exercise group revealed a significant improvement in three of the five items involved in the scale(attention, motor skills and academic and classroom behavior) with p  0.05).\n\nConclusion: It could be concluded that regular aerobic exercises program has a positive effect in improving symptoms of ADHD.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Sensation Seeking and Delinquency among Saudi Adolescents",
    "abstract": "Juvenile delinquents in Saudi Arabia pores a serious social issue in today's society. The most frequent types of offences reported in Saudi\"s juvenile offences statistics are theft offences followed by assault offences, traffic violations, drugs offences and property damage or vandalism.The primary purpose of the present paper was to understand the relationship between sensation seeking and the most common offences (Theft, assault, traffic violations, substance use, and vandalism) among rural and urban male adolescents in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the second purpose of the present paper was to explore delinquent adolescents\" perspectives for giving up their engagement in delinquency behaviours. Data was collected through quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data was collected through the use of questionnaires and derived from a survey of 2168 high school students (16- 18 year old), 1676 adolescents were randomly recruited from urban areas, while 492 were randomly recruited from rural areas. Moreover, the interviews were presented to provide support for the quantitative results and further explanation for the purpose of this study. The qualitative findings are derived from conducting interviews with 24 delinquent adolescents who had engaged in delinquent activities as leisure by snowball sampling technique (urban= 16 adolescents, rural=8 adolescents). Sensation seeking differences emerged between the two geographical locations. The result revealed that urban adolescents significantly higher in Sensation seeking than rural adolescents. In terms of delinquency behaviours, results showed that there was no significant difference between urban and rural adolescents in total delinquency; however, the patterns of delinquency are not homogeneous across locations. Urban adolescents reported significantly higher rates of involvement in assault, traffic violations and vandalism offences. However, however, substance use was significantly higher in rural areas than urban areas. While, theft offences and arrests there were no significant differences between them. The result (based on quantitative and qualitative findings) revealed that adolescents committed delinquent activities not only as an escape-based coping strategy from boredom but because such activities have provided the delinquent adolescents with the desired sensation of arousal as they described.In light of study findings, participants keenly expressed a big desire to participate in recreation activities and extreme recreation activities in particular. However, there is a distinct lack of leisure and recreation facilities within both of the two geographical areas. Therefore, there is a need to provide adolescents with recreation facilities. Recreation activities especially extreme recreation activities should be offered for them to be a legal alternative source of arousal for high sensation seekers because exciting recreation activities sustain and fulfill their thirst for excitement and provide the sensation seekers with the desired sensation of arousal.",

    "abstract": "The current study was designed to explore the prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) in primary schools in Saudi Arabia. The study collected data from both teachers and parents for 708 primary school pupils attending grades 1-3 (7-9 years old), using DSM-IV criteria of ADHD. The result showed that the overall rate of ADHD was 2.7%, and in particular, the rate of attention types, 2.0%; hyperactive/impulsivity type, 1.4% and combined type, 0.7%. Teachers reported ADHD in a higher frequency than parents. However, applying a combination of reports from teachers and parents, screening of ADHD is likely to be more accurate. These findings highlight the importance of detecting ADHD in pupils at an early age and to develop a specific set of psychological clinical interventions for helping them.",

Specifically, this qualitative research study in Saudi Arabia investigated the phenomenological and diagnostic confusion between giftedness and AD/HD. Three mainstream regular classroom teachers, one specialist teacher of gifted children, and the parents of three gifted children were interviewed. All participants’ perceptions focused on the behavioural dimensions of teacher-nominated gifted children at school and at home. In general, the results indicate that diagnostic confusions between giftedness and AD/HD were manifest, and teachers’ and parents’ perspectives differed. Some unanticipated and interesting data also emerged from the research. In discussion of the results, a number of themes relating to the misidentification of gifted children are discussed. Some educational implications for future research directions are offered.",

Method: All epidemiological studies on ADHD conducted from 1966 through the present were reviewed. Samples were drawn from the general community, primary care clinical set- tings, and populations of traumatized children. Data on prevalence, gender differences, risk factors, comorbidity, and burden of ADHD were reviewed Results: ADHD rates in Arab populations were similar to those in other cultures. Comparisons within Arab studies were difficult given the variability of methodology and instruments used. Conclusion: There is an important need for research on ADHD in the Arab World, not only to assess the national prevalence in children and adolescents, but also to look at the differential burden and treatment of this disorder, which has high levels of mental comorbidities and high impact across the life span.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Psychosocial problems are common health concerns in children. Therefore, it is essential for pediatricians to be able to identify psychiatric disorders. This depends on the knowledge, practice and attitudes towards psychiatric disorders in childhood. Methods:  A constructed questionnaire of items about knowledge, practice and attitudes of pediatricians toward psychiatric disorders in childhood was used. Four hundred and fifty questionnaires were distributed and collected from pediatricians in seven main governmental hospitals in Riyadh over a period of three months (between March 1 and May 30 2005). Findings were analyzed statistically. Results: About 88.8% of the samples had not had any training in child psychiatry during their residency. Forty-eight percent were hesitant in diagnosing psychiatric disorders in children, 76.5% were not confident enough to treat these children, 48.5% were not confident enough to follow them up after being managed by a child psychiatrist and 49.9% were not confident to treat common side effects of psychotropic medications. About 88.8% of the pediatricians thought that pediatricians needed training in child psychiatry during pediatric residency programs. Conclusion: A significant number of pediatricians reported a lack of training in child psychiatry during residency programs. This has an adverse impact on their knowledge, attitudes and possibly practices in dealing with childhood psychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among male primary school children in Dammam, Saudi Arabia: prevalence and associated factors",
    "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders that develop in children and becomes apparent in the preschool and early school years. Several family and maternal-related factors were shown to be associated with ADHD. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of ADHD and associated family and psychosocial factors among male primary school children in Dammam city, Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 1287 students aged 6-13 years in 67 government and 10 private primary schools was selected by multistage systematic random sampling. Data was collected using two types of questionnaires: the modified Arabic version of the Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scale (ADDES) school version, and Parents\" questionnaire to diagnose the three main subtypes of ADHD namely: inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and combined ADHD. The majority of the boys were from government schools (83.0%), were of age 6-6-<9 years (40.5%) and of Saudi nationality (80.7%). The overall prevalence of combined ADHD was 16.4%, with a prevalence of 12.4% for hyperactivity-impulsivity and 16.3% for inattention disorders respectively. The study also revealed a variety of family factors to be significantly associated with the development of ADHD. The prevalence of each subtype of ADHD was higher if the child was the 6th one in the family. The prevalence of hyperactivity-impulsivity disorder was significantly higher among children living with single parents than those living with both parents (25.0% vs. 12.2% respectively; ρ =0.016). Inattention was significantly higher among those who had bottle feeding than breastfeeding (21.2% vs. 14.4% respectively; ρ=0.03). Conclusion and recommendations: several approaches directed to the child, family, the primary health care services, the school, and the community should be implemented to reduce the prevalence and incidence of ADHD.",

Objectives: determination of the prevalence rate of emotional and/or behavioral problems among male Saudi school- children and identifying their possible risk factors. Method: All male schoolchildren of Al-Abnae schools specialized for the sons of the employees of the Saudi Ministry of Defense (military and civilians) in Taif Governorate, Saudi Arabia were included. This study was conducted through two phases: A screening phase for all schoolchildren and adolescents included in the study through a cross sectional approach to assess their emotional and behavioral problems. A case-control phase to study risk factors. The screening phase was conducted using the Child Behavior Checklist ’Parents\" form\". Results: Among 1313 participated in the study, 109 (8.3%) were emotionally and/or behaviorally disturbed students (according to cut-off score for boys estimated at the 90th percentiles). Among studied socio-demographic variables, educational level (intermediate versus primary) and mother occupation (working versus non-working) were associated with a higher risk higher risk of developing emotional and/or behavioral disturbance. Unwanted pregnancy (OR=4.77, CI: 3.68-5.86), history of meningitis (OR=7.50, CI: 5.12-9.88), accidents (OR=4.07, CI: 2.87-5.26) and bronchial asthma (OR=2.96, CI: 2.16-3.76) had an increased risk of emotional and/or behavioral disturbance.",

Of these, 28.3% had coexistent expressive language disorder and 38.7% coexistent mild mental retardation. A psychostimulant (methylphenidate) was prescribed to 23.6% while antidepressants (primarily imipramine) were prescribed to 35.9%. Behavioural therapy was the most commonly offered psychotherapy. Antidepressants were used more than psychostimulants. Psychotropics had a more beneficial effect than psychotherapy.",

Although psychosocial and behavioral therapies are of great therapeutic values, the psychopharmacological drugs are often used in the treatment of patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. With a combined approach, a substantial proportion of patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (90%) show good recovery. The patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder need careful evaluation and appropriate long-term treatment in order to prevent subsequent negative consequences.

    "abstract": "This is an epidemiologic study of 199 children and adolescents who were referred for evaluation to a child psychiatry clinic in a teaching hospital in Riyadh,Saudi Arabia during a 6 year period. Objectives: (I) to clarify who utilizes the services of a child psychiatry clinic. (2) what are the psychological problems that triggers the referral, and (3) compare our results with western literature on similar clinical populations of children and adolescents. Methods: All children referred to the childpsychiatry clinic were assessed using a semi-structured interview according to the +AP DSM-III system and a modified global assessment of functioning scale providedfor the fourth axis of the DSM III. Results: Significant findings which differ from literature reports include: a low representation of conduct disorder (5%), highrepresentations of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (12.6%), mental retardation (20Tc), conversion disorder (8%) and obsessional disorder (4%). First referred to traditional healers were 46% and there was a low rate (0.6%)of referral from pediatricians compared to 22% in western societies. Discussion: The results are discussed with emphasis on socio-cultural perspectives.",
