  "title": "Prevalence Rates of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder in Gifted and Talented Students in Saudi Arabia",
  "abstract": "<p>Reports have estimated worldwide-pooled prevalence rates for Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) to be 5.2%–7.2%. However, estimated prevalence rates can be difficult to determine due to the variability of diagnoses within and among different countries. Prevalence rates for ADHD among 22 Arab countries has been found to range between 1.3% and 16%. In this study, the researchers examined the prevalence twice-exceptionality – those students who are gifted with ADHD – among 766 students aged 5–17 attending private and public schools in Saudi Arabia. Implications for the findings of this study include the need for more education regarding the needs of these students among teachers and parents, as well as the form and type of educational programming provided to them in schools.</p>",
