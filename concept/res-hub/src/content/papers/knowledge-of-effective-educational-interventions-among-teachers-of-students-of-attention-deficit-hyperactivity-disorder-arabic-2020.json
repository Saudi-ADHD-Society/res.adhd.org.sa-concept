  "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the knowledge of Effective Educational Interventions among Teachers of Students of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. To achieve that purpose, the researcher used the descriptive survey method on a sample of (441) teachers from (general and special education) in schools in Riyadh that implemented (ADHD) programs. The study findings indicated that teachers of students with (ADHD) knowledge of effective educational interventions varied. It also found that female teachers’ knowledge of interventions is greater than the knowledge of male teachers. The exception was the cooperative learning intervention, in which the results were in favour of male teachers more than females. Moreover, the results showed that the knowledge of special education teachers of educational interventions was greater than that of general education teachers, and that the knowledge of teachers with less experience was greater. In addition, the knowledge of teachers who received training courses in the field of (ADHD) was greater than those who did not receive training courses in the field.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ajsp.net/research/معرفة_معلمي_التلاميذ_ذوي_اضطراب_فرط_الحركة.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source Link</a> [Arabic]",
