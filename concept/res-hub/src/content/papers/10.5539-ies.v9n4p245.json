  "title": "Mind Maps to Modify Lack of Attention among Saudi Kindergarten Children",
  "abstract": "This research study aims at investigating the impact of Mind Maps on modifying the lack of attention in Arabic language class among Saudi Kindergarten children. To achieve the goals of this study the researcher used an experimental design with a random sample from AlRae&quot;d Kindergarten&quot;s children in Riyadh -Saudi Arabia for the academic year (2014-2015). The study sample consisted of (40) children divided into two groups: (23) in the experimental and (17) in the control group. The researcher used Al-Obeidi&quot;s (1999) Lack of Attention Scale LAS. Validity of the tool was approved through a half division to measure lack of attention (0.93) which is considered good. The scale was used before and after the implementation of the experiment on both groups. Results showed a positive change in attention concentration in favor of the experimental group. Thus, the researcher recommended the use of Mind Maps in teaching kindergarten children to avoid attention deficiency.",
