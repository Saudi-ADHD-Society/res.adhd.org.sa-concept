  "title": "Speech and Language Disorders in ADHD",
  "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) refers to the presence of pronounced difficulties in the areas of inattention, distractibility and hyperactivity that lead to significant impairment in academic and social functioning [1]. The prevalence estimate of ADHD is as wide as 3%-10% for school age children [2] and it is identified as one of the most commonly diagnosed clinical conditions affecting the student population [3]. Two-thirds of children with ADHD have an additional coexisting disorder [4] and more than one-third have at least three comorbid conditions [5]. Estimates of the overlap between speech and language disorders and ADHD vary from as low as 8% to as high as 90%, depending on the source and type of sample [2]. I will discuss the possible and levels of association between ADHD and speech and language disorders. Also, I will describe the link between the ADHD diagnosis and speech and language disorders in children, supported by evidence from several studies.",
