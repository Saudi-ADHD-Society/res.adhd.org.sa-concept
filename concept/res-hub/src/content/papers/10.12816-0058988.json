  "title": "The Prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Internet Gaming Disorder, and their Association among Adults in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study",
  "abstract": "<strong>Background</strong>: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) prevalence in children in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was found to be 3.4–5%. ADHD is not an exclusive childhood disease although it has a childhood onset. Studies have shown that ADHD symptoms continue through adulthood in 50% and through adolescence in 70% of those who have it. Many studies have reported an association between ADHD and Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and most of these studies were done on children. Increased video game use was predicted in ADHD symptoms and higher scores of IGD occurring among children with ADHD compared to those who do not have ADHD. However, fewer studies among adults have reported an association between ADHD and excessive gaming.",
