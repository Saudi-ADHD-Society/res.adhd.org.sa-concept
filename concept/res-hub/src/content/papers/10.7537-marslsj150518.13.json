  "title": "Teaching Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in selected primary schools in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",
  "abstract": "Recently, there has been considerable interest in children with ADHD in Saudi Arabia. However, when analysing further, it is clear that this interest is only visible in medical areas, and is not given consideration in educational areas. This research discussed the educational status of children with ADHD, since several studies have confirmed that many of the children with this diagnosis face learning difficulties in reading and/or writing, maths, and more. The results emphasise that teachers adopt varying approaches to teaching, and these may be positive or negative. Moreover, advice was shared amongst teachers of such children, with the statement made that knowledge into ADHD is needed, further stating that a number of challenges are faced when seeking to deliver the most suitable learning environment. The study suggested that teachers should be afforded ADHD-relevant training, with advice on how to work with ADHD children&quot;s parents/carers.",
