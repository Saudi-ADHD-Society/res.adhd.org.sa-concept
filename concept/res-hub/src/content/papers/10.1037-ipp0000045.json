  "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is among the most prevalent disorders of childhood and adolescence worldwide. Teachers are likely to play an important role in multiple stages of the help-seeking process (e.g., problem recognition) for children with ADHD. This study examined the relationship of prior exposure and ADHD training with teachers knowledge and misconceptions of the disorder in a multinational sample. Teachers (N = 2,307) from nine countries (Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Iraq, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, United States, and Vietnam) completed measures of ADHD knowledge, prior exposure, and education/training related to ADHD. There was considerable variability in overall levels of knowledge and specific misconceptions across the countries sampled. Although the predictors of ADHD knowledge varied considerably across countries, some form of professional training and prior exposure to ADHD was associated with greater knowledge in the majority of countries. Implications for teacher training and the role teachers can play in the help-seeking process are discussed. <strong>Note</strong>: Saudi data published previously in 2013 (PDF: <a href=//www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=40861 target=_blank>Teachers&rsquo; Knowledge and Misconceptions of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)",
