  "abstract": "<strong>Objectives</strong>: Mental disorders manifest as social, occupational, or emotional dysfunctions. Many countries struggle to recognize mental disorders and their effects on communities. Mental health awareness in Saudi Arabia has improved in recent years as psychiatric treatment has become more acceptable in Saudi society. The aim of this study was to determine the percentages of mental disorders among a hospital population at Hera General Hospital, Makkah, Saudi Arabia, using the diagnostic criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases. We aimed to determine sex differences and to identify the five most common disorders.",
