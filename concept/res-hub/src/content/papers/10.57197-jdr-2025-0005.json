  "title": "Effects of Mindfulness E-Activities on Academic Resilience in ADD/ADHD Students",
  "abstract": "<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how students with attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) feel about their academic prospects after engaging in mindfulness-based online activities. The study aimed to identify the effect of e-activities based on mindfulness on the academic buoyancy of students with ADHD. The study employed a semi-experimental approach to investigate the impact of e-activities based on mindfulness on enhancing the academic buoyancy of university students diagnosed with ADHD. The participants were 50 hyperactive and distracted students. On an achievement test, they scored over 60 on the self-estimation scale for adults with ADHD. Two experimental groups were randomly assigned. Twenty-five are the electronic activity group and 25 are the control group. The study found that there were statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group and the control group in the post-measurement in academic buoyancy in favor of the experimental group. Also, the study found that there are statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group in academic buoyancy in the post and follow-up measurements in favor of the follow-up measurement. The results can help those in charge of university education to take advantage of e-activities to improve the academic buoyancy of these students. Also, providing e-activities that can be used with students with ADHD to overcome academic problems they face and improve their academic level.</p>",
