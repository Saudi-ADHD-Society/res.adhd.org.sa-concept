  "title": "Dietary and lifestyle habits among adolescent girls in Saudi Arabia: A comparison between private and government schools",
  "abstract": "Purpose - The main purpose of this study was to explore the differences in dietary habits and lifestyle between girls in government and private schools in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional multistage stratified survey was carried out on schoolgirls aged 12-19 years. The total sample was 512 girls (291 and 221 girls from government and private schools, respectively). A pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Findings - The findings revealed that girls in private schools were significantly more likely to consume vegetables, fruits, red meat, and chicken than those in government schools. Furthermore, private schoolgirls were less prone to watch television and use the internet daily than girls in government schools. Originality/value - Intervention for promoting healthy lifestyles in schoolchildren should not exclude private schools.",
