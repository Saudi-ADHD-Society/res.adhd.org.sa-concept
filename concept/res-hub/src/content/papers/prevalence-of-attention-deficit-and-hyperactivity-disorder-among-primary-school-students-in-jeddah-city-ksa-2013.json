  "title": "Prevalence of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder among Primary School Students in Jeddah city, KSA",
  "abstract": "This study aimed at identifying the spread of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as its subtypes, in a sample of primary school children in Jeddah, KSA. The implemented tool was the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Scale. This instrument was administered to 2770 students with a range of 6-12 years. The findings of the study reveal that the prevalence of ADHD was estimated to be 11.6%. The subtypes results indicate: a prevalence of 6.3% for ADD, a prevalence of 2.2% for HD. The third type that is the combined hyperactive/ impulsive and inattentive type of ADHD has a prevalence of 3.1%. The results show that there is a difference between ADHD prevalence among elementary school children due to the difference in age. Furthermore, the total prevalence percentage of ADHD for female students was (4.2%). The total prevalence percentage of ADHD for male students was (7.4%).",
