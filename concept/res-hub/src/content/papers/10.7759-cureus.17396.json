  "title": "Patterns of Injuries Among Children Diagnosed With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Aseer Region, Southwestern Saudi Arabia",
  "abstract": "<strong>Background: </strong>Globally, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder that affects children. In 2011, there was an ADHD diagnosis prevalence of around 8% among children (4-17 years) in the US. ADHD-affected children are more prone to physical injuries such as physical trauma, accidental poisoning, burns, etc. This study was aimed to evaluate the association of ADHD with severe injuries, the influence of age and gender on this association, and the impact of ADHD medications on the frequency of such injuries.",
