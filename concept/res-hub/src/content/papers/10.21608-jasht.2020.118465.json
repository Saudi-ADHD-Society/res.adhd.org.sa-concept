  "title": "Saudi Clinicians’ and Teachers’ Discourses About Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",
  "abstract": "ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed neurobehavioral disorder among children. Using Foucauldian discourse analysis, this study uncovers the discourses drawn upon by six Saudi teachers and four clinicians as they describe their experiences and understanding of ADHD. Saudi clinicians approach ADHD as an extension of American medical views in terms of its causes, diagnosis and treatment. Alarmingly, in light of the shortage of recommended ADHD medications, there are accounts of antipsychotic medications being prescribed for children. Saudi teachers views of ADHD were an extension of the medical discourse; this meant that students strengths were ignored and the focus was entirely on negative behavioral patterns. Despite the tendency to attribute ADHD to genetics, teachers objectified students who acted out' as having ADHD or even other disorders (when the child's behavior or symptoms diverged from their limited understanding of ADHD).",
