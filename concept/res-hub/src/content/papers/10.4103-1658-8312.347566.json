  "title": "Elementary School Teachers’ Knowledge Regarding Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Ha’il City",
  "abstract": "<strong>Aims:</strong> Teachers are often the first to recognize that their students have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), since students and teachers are in contact most school days, and teachers notice how average students usually perform in the school setting. There were two aims in this study; 1) to assess teachers’ knowledge regarding ADHD and 2) to investigate socio-demographic differences between teachers on their knowledge of ADHD in the city of Ha’il, Saudi Arabia.",
