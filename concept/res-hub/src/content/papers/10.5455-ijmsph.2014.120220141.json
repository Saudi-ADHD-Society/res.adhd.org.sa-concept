  "title": "Knowledge and Misperceptions Towards Diagnosis and Management of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) among primary school and kindergarten female teachers in Al-Rusaifah district, Makkah City, Saudi Arabia",
  "abstract": "Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder of childhood and adolescence and it is one of the most common psychiatric disorders that cause distress in the lives of both children and adult. If ADHD remains undetected the child may experience academic failure, rejection by peers, and develop low self-esteem. Teachers are seen as one of the most valuable sources of information with regard to referral and diagnosis of ADHD. They also have the responsibility for creating an environment conductive to academic, social and emotional success for children with ADHD.",
