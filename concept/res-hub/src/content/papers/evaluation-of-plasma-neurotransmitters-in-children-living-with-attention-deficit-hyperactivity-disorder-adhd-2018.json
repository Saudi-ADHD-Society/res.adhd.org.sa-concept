  "title": "Evaluation of plasma neurotransmitters in children living with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to ascertain the underlying neuro-biochemical imbalances that exist in children with ADHD by assessing the plasma levels of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, _ amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Moreover, it investigated the potential effects of PUFA and vitamins supplementation as an alternative therapy to modulate the levels of these neurotransmitters and the overall clinical status of ADHD patients. The study included 40 ADHD patients, aged 4-6 years. The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) test has been employed to diagnose patients with ADHD and the severity of symptoms was assessed using the Arabic version of Conners' Parent Rating Scale. Additionally, patients were assessed using the Arabic versions of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children (M.I.N.I. Kid) and Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, 5th Edition (SB5). Recruited patient received nutritional supplement of semi-solid diet containing 1000 mg PUFA with selected vitamins once daily for six months. The evaluation of ADHD symptoms and levels of neurotransmitters has been carried out at pre-/post-intervention stage. Post-nutrition intervention assessment, there was a significant increase in dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA levels (p-value < 0.0001) with significant decrease in glutamate level (p-value < 0.0001) when compared to their correspondent pre-intervention levels. Symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity were significantly improved after 6 months nutrition intervention program (p-value<0.001). Therefore, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins could be considered more extensively in therapy of ADHD patients particularly those who are less than 6 years old",
