  "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children and adolescents. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the available evidence on the prevalence and correlates of ADHD in Saudi Arabia.

The pooled prevalence estimate and associated factors were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.",
