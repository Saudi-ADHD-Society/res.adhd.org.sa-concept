  "title": "Prevalence of Enuresis in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Diagnosed With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
  "abstract": "<strong>Background</strong> Enuresis, or bedwetting, is a common condition affecting millions of children worldwide. This can be a source of distress for both children and their families. Children, adolescents, and young adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at risk of developing enuresis. They have difficulties with executive functioning, including impulse control and emotional regulation. These difficulties may contribute to the development of enuresis, as individuals may struggle to recognize the urge to use the bathroom or have difficulty controlling their bladder during sleep.",
