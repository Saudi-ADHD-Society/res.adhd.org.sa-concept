  "title": "Children with emotional and behavioral disorders in Saudi Arabia: a teacher preliminary screening",
  "abstract": "Children with emotional and behavioral disorders, although a distinct category of children with special needs, are neither identified nor served in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study was to extend previous efforts to estimate the prevalence of emotional and behavioral disorders among children in Saudi Arabia in order to evaluate the need for intervention services. In the current study, teachers of students aged 4-17 years in Saudi Arabia were surveyed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire – Teacher version. The findings of the study suggest that students with emotional and behavioral disorders in Saudi Arabia may account for almost 25% of the population of school students between the ages of 4 and 17. The findings also revealed that teachers complained the most about behaviors that are related to conduct followed by problems with peer relationship.",
