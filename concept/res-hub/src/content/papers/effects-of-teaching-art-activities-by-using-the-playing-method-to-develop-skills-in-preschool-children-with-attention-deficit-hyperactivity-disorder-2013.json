  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of teaching art activities on thinking and behavioural skills in pre-school students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). A program was designed and applied to teach certain art activities with the Playing method and to measure the thinking and behavioural skills before and after applying the program, by using observation. The sample consisted of 14 boys and girls identified with ADHD by the ADHD Rating Scale for children. They were divided into experimental and control groups matched for several demographic factors. After the experiment was completed, our comparisons demonstrated some beneficial and significant effects of the art program on the thinking and behavioural skills of the children who took part in the activities.",
